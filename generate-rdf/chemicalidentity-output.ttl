according to the applicant, the sccs remark on the ifra standard would be taken into consideration updating the upcoming 48th amendment, but stated that the global scope of ifra regulations for the

however, the applicant would only refer to the eu cas number 84082-84-8 Vetiveria zizanioides ext. acetylated for this dossier. the applicant also agreed that the cas number 117-98-6 refers to a

1,2,3,3a,4,5,6,8a-octahydro-2-isopropylidene-4,8-dimethylazulen-6-yl acetate) whereas cas number 117-98-6 identifies 2,6-dimethyl-9-isopropylidenbicyclo(5.3.0)dec-2-en-4-yl-acetate. the applicant explained that different cas numbers had been incorrectly used in the past to describe the same commercial fragrance material, i.e. acetylated vetiver oil (avo), for which a single cas 84082-84-8 is now proposed and used by the industry. the applicant also confirmed that all the tests presented in submission 2 dossier of 11 June 2013 (ref 1) had been conducted on acetylated vetiver oil (avo), and although some reports stated vetiveryl acetate (cas 117-98-6), the test article used in the studies was in fact what is now known as acetylated vetiver oil (avo) (cas 84082-84-8). based on the applicant's explanation, the sccs is willing to accept that the studies referring to cas 117-98-6 can be regarded as applicable to the acetylated vetiver oil (avo) (acetylated extract of vetiveria zizanoides, cas 84082-84-8) for the purpose of this assessment. however, the sccs is also aware of the limitations placed by the glp system on making any corrections/additions to a final report in the form of amendments which also need to be signed and dated by the Study Director. the sccs considers it to be the sole responsibility of the applicant to clarify/amend the cas number in the study reports through relevant institutions/authorities. the sccs also advises the applicant to get the relevant CosIng entries amended so that the material is question is correctly defined in terms of a single identifiable cas number. sccs comment on purity:  avo is the acetylated form of a natural fragrance (vetiver oil), which is composed of around 129 constituents. data presented by industry (13 may 2015) (ref 2) concerned the analysis of 18 samples of different avo batches produced by 10 manufacturers comparing analytical data from 2007 and 2015 shows that the range of variability of the constituents of acetylated vetiver, considered during an extended period of time, can be accepted for samples of natural origin. the sccs has considered this variation acceptable for a plant-derived material of natural origin and on the basis of this presumption sccs considered avo as a single entity on which to assess the toxicity. sccs comment on partition coefficient:  providing a measure of logKow for a complex multi-constituent substance such as acetylated vetiver oil (avo) is not meaningful, given the wide range of different structures and moieties. this could only result in a log Kow spanning several digits. logP values have been provided. however, the sccs notes that chemical characterisation of the compounds that correspond to these seventeen logP values has not been provided. sccs comment on stability: stability data provided by the applicant contain only raw data without any interpretation of the results. based on the sccs notes of guidance (sccs/1602/18), more details on stability should have been provided." ;

CI 45430 (Erythrosine) is listed in Annex IV of the EU Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC which permits its use as a colorant in cosmetic products, without a concentration limit for this use. It is, however, not permitted as a hair dye ingredient because a safety dossier supporting its use was not provided under the European Hair Dye strategy(1) and thesubstance was subsequently banned for this use2 (Annex II, entry 1337). Erythrosine is historically reported as being used in a range of cosmetic applications including toothpaste, lipstick, eye products, face decorative products, bath & shower products, hair products including sprays & conditioners, shampoos, deodorants, fragrance products, and soap (COLIPA 2006). Following calls for toxicological data on this colour, only the use of this colour in toothpaste products has been actively defended. For this reason this dossier only supports the use of erythrosine in toothpaste products up to a level of 0.0025% and does not relate to its safety in all cosmetic applications. As a food colorant, erythrosine is added to a range of products to include sweets (Turkish delight), biscuits, glace and tinned cherries and sausages. Following a review of the available scientific data, The European Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) has allocated an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0 to 0.1 mg/kg body weight (SCF, 1987). In 1990, the same ADI was assigned by the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee for Food Additives (JECFA, 1990), following a re-evaluation of the safety of this colorant. In the EU, Erythrosine is permitted as a colorant in foodstuff3 . It is limited for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries up to a maximum level of 200 mg/kg and in Bigarreaux cherries in syrup and cocktails up to 150 mg/kg. Erythrosine is also approved for use in EU pharmaceutical preparations as a colorant in both solid (capsules/tablets/sugar-coated pills) and liquid (drops/syrups) pharmaceutical preparations. In 1988, The Scientific Committee on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (SCMPMD) issued a favourable opinion on the use of erythrosine in pharmaceutical products. Erythrosine is typically present at levels of 0.0017 to 0.96 mg/capsule or tablet respectively and at levels of 0.009 to 0.8 mg/mL for oral liquid preparations. In the US, FD&C Red 3 is permanently listed for use in foods and ingested drugs. In 1990, erythrosine was de-listed by FDA for use in cosmetics and externally applied drugs, following the initial suggested findings that this colorant may induce carcinogenicity in rats. The FDA adopted the Delaney clause which restricts the use of any ingredient, regardless of the amount used, if an ingredient is shown to induce cancer in animals or humans. The FDA did not have an immediate safety concern with this colorant and identified the potential risk based on the data available as about 1 in 100, 000 over a 70 year lifetime. This colorant remains approved for use in the U.S. in foods and ingested drugs. 1: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/hair-dye-products/safety-strategy/index_en.htm" ;

        ont:function_and_uses          "DHA is a self-tanning agent. More specifically, the application of a DHA-containing selftanning formulation to the skin produces a reaction between DHA and skin contents. DHA reacts with the amino acids and amino groups of proteins present in sweat, keratin and skin, eventually leading to the production of coloured melanoidins. The applicant explains that there is much evidence to suggest that the process is similar to the \"maillard reaction\", also known as non-enzymatic browning. 2 - 6 hours after application, a brown coloration appears that has a similar hue to that of natural sun tan. as the DHA molecules are bound to free amino acids and proteins of the skin, the colour obtained is substantive and cannot easily be washed off. It only fades in the course of mechanical abrasion or natural exfoliation of the skin. DHA has been used worldwide in cosmetic products, i.e. skin care products for face and body, instant tan formulations and 'flash bronzers' in combination with colorants. The applicant (Colipa, representing 8 cosmetic companies) wishes to support the use of DHA in face creams and body lotions at a concentration of up to 10%. The recommended use levels depend on the skin type and tanning status of the user: Ca. 3 - 5 % in formulations for persons with light skin (skin type I - II), Ca. 5 - 10 % in formulations for persons with dark skin (skin type III - IV / V), Ca. 1 - 2 % in formulations for skin care products (creams and lotions). the use of DHA solutions in spray cabins, however, is not supported by Colipa, as none of its member companies manufacture products used in spray cabins. ref.: 1. a report of the danish toxicology centre (DTC) summarizes the major spraying systems used to treat customers with DHA self-tanning creams (containing 8-14% of dha): 1) the manual turbine spray or spraying ‘pistol’, spraying a high air volume under low pressure onto the skin. The formulation is sprayed from about 15 cm distance from the customer’s body. 2) the third-generation spray booth, consisting of a closed compartment in which, after a short countdown, 3 rows of nozzles spray lotion on the entire body. turning around is not necessary, as the whole body is treated in one spray action. once the spraying stops, the customer immediately leaves the spraying compartment, in which a thick aerosol mist has meanwhile been formed. 3) the fourth-generation spray booth, i.e. an open booth, in which the formulation is charged to 40,000 V and sprayed through 2 vertical rows of nozzles. the customer stands on two earthed metal plates so that the lotion hits her/his body very accurately through electrostatic energy. after 2-3 seconds, the customer turns around and the other side of the body is treated. in addition, the DTC document reports on some important exposure parameters related to each of the spraying systems, and on the DHA levels measured in the air around the mouth/nose during treatment in a number of operational booths. parameter: amount of formulation used, manual turbine spray: ± 25 ml, third-generation (closed) spray booth: ± 60 ml, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: ± 15 ml; parameter: application time, manual turbine spray: 2-3 minutes, third-generation (closed) spray booth: 6 seconds, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: 4-6 seconds; parameter: estimated inhalation exposure, manual turbine spray: aerosol cloud is minimal, thus minimal inhalation exposure, third-generation (closed) spray booth: a thick aerosol mist is present in the spraying compartment, thus inhalation is likely. fourth-generation (open) spray booth: aerosol drops are 10 x smaller than in third generation booths; nevertheless, inhalation is expected to be low due to ‘electrostatic precision’; parameter: protective measures to be taken, manual turbine spray: no specific measures, third-generation (closed) spray booth: customer is advised to keep eyes and mouth shut during treatment, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: customer is advised to use nose filters and eye protection; parameter: measured DHA concentration (droplets < 12µm), manual turbine spray: 0.8 mg/m³ air, third-generation (closed) spray booth: up to 238 mg/m³ air, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: up to 17 mg/m³ air; parameter: calculated exposure level per treatment (general inhalation rate of 1.5 m³/hour is assumed for adult man (low activity) [technical guidance document on risk assessment, part I, European commission, ecb, 2003].), manual turbine spray: (0.05h x 1.5m³/hour x 0.8 mg/m³) = 0.06 mg dha, third-generation (closed) spray booth: (0.0017h x 1.5m³/hour x 238 mg/m³) = 0.61 mg dha, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: (0.0017h x 1.5m³/hour x 17 mg/m³) = 0.04 mg dha. ref.: 12." ;

According to the authors, the results of this study indicate the appropriate development and validation of the analytical method for the measurement of the DHA concentration in bidistilled water, as well as the appropriate stability of the dosing solutions used in the different toxicity studies. stability tests according to ICH-Q1A guideline showed that DHA batch number VL720150 stored at 2 – 8°C is stable for at least 18 months. as a general statement, the storage stability of dha at 4 – 8 °C is declared to be at least 18 months. ref.: 1 the summary sheets of some additional stability tests indicate DHA batch numbers VL438450, VL438550 and VL438650 to be stable for 48 months at 5 ± 3°C. ref.: 11." ;

Triclosan was approved in 1986 by the European community cosmetic directive for preservative in cosmetics products at concentrations up to 0.3%. Triclosan was evaluated also by scf [scf, 2000, ar8] and ESFA [ESFA, 2004, ar6] for use in food contact materials and classified in scf_list 3 with a restriction of 5 mg/kg of food. other fields of applications are textiles (i.e., sport wear) and plastic materials (i.e., plastic containers, brushes), with a Triclosan concentration of up to 0.3%. in the eu, about 85% of the total volume of Triclosan is used in personal care products, compared to 5% for textiles and 10% for plastics and food contact materials. the quantity used within the ec reached approximately 450 tons (as 100% active) in the year 2006. at or near typical usage levels, Triclosan appears to intercalate into the membrane of bacteria, resulting in destabilised structure/function. this level of exposure results in disruption of nutrient uptake, inhibition of amino acid incorporation, inhibition of uracil incorporation, as well as membrane lysis.

        ont:homogeneity_and_stability  "photo-induced bond isomerisation from trans to cis gives the other known retinol isomers: 11-cis (neo b), 13-cis (neo a), 9, 13-di-cis (iso b), 9-cis (iso a), and 11, 13-di-cis (neo c). particularly in oil solution, retinol can be protected from isomerisation by preventing exposure to UV and sunlight. bond isomerisation can be caused by heat and iodine. high levels of illumination can induce polymerisation. retinol is sensitive to oxygen, heat, light and heavy metals. it is optimally stored below 4°C under an inert gas (argon or nitrogen) or in the presence of an antioxidant (e.g. butylated hydroxytoluene, tocopherol). heat and trace metals accelerate retinol decomposition by oxygen and light. retinol is unstable to acids, which cause bond rearrangement to retro-vitamin A, isomerisation, and dehydration to anhydro-vitamin A, sometimes followed by solvent addition. retinol is also unstable to alkali in the presence of oxygen (unlike the palmitate ester). retinol and its acetate can bind strongly to polyvinyl chloride in plastics. stability of different retinol grades differ in respect to used antioxidant systems and ranged between 6–24 months, if stored below 15–20 °C. retinol in cosmetic formulations is stable for ≥6 months if manufactured under inert atmosphere and stored e.g., in aluminium tubes at ≤ 20 °C.

Therefore, the toxicity associated with the boron compounds listed in Annex II to this mandate is expected to be similar based on boron equivalents. Boron oxide will produce similar effects because it is an anhydride that reacts exothermically with water in the body to form boric acid. In aqueous solutions of sodium perborate at room temperature an equilibrium between sodium perborate and hydrogen peroxide/sodium metaborate is instantly established. Sodium metaborate is the salt of a strong base (sodium hydroxide) and a weak acid (boric acid). Therefore, it is expected to be present in aqueous solutions at environmental temperature and ph mainly as the weakly dissociated boric acid. Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate is a solid solution of boric acid and disodium tetraborate decahydrate. Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate is converted into boric acid//borate upon dissolution in water (EU, 2009b).

Cosmet. Sci., 60, 485-500) . the author emphasised that the method may be used to quantitatively determine several retinoids and their isomers in cosmetic products but it is unclear if the HPLC method has been applied to the analysis of the batches used in toxicity testing. this method does not include retinyl acetate, retinyl linoleate or retinal. calculations use international units (IUs) or retinol equivalents (REs). a conversion of the individual derivatives into IUs can be found as follow: 1IU of vitamin A corresponds to vitamin A derivative 1IU corresponds to 0.300 μg of retinol, to 0.345 μg retinyl acetate, to 0.359 μg retinyl propionate, and to 0.550 μg of retinyl palmitate" ;

        ont:function_and_uses  "these products are usually presented as anti-wrinkle agents. in particular, retinol and its esters, mainly retinyl palmitates and acetates, are used in products such as face and eye creams, body lotions, sun lotions, lip products and baby creams, above all because of their anti-ageing effect. they induce biosynthesis of collagen in the skin and, at the same time, impede the UV-induced synthesis of collagen-reducing enzymes. these cosmetics promise to smooth wrinkles and fine lines in skin aged by both time and sun exposure. in toothpastes, vitamin A serves to protect the gum epithelium against marginal parodontitis (Buddecke et al. 1981). external topical retinoids may reverse dermatological disorders most likely by interfering with local retinoid functions. hence, topical retinoids have been used for clinical treatment of psoriasis, hyperkeratosis, acne, early aging and photodamage. the retinoids seem to play a role in the aging process of the skin, since many age-dependent changes may be reversed by topical application. in the dermis, topical retinoids may increase synthesis and inhibit degradation of collagen, changes that are associated with improvement of coarse wrinkling. in the epidermis, topical retinoids may cause hyperplasia, compaction of the stratum corneum, thickening of the granular layer and increased intercellular mucin deposition. these changes are associated with increased smoothness of the skin (VKM, 2012). apparently the anti-aging effect of topical retinoids is mainly linked to the receptor mediated gene activation induced by the ligand retinoic acid modulating epidermal cell proliferation and differentiation, extracellular matrix production, angiogenesis, oxidative stress and melanocyte function (Sorg et al., 2006; Sorg and Saurat, 2014). according to the intracrine-proligand concept, the other topical retinoids have to be metabolised to retinoic acid by the skin to exert their genomic effects. this concept implies that topical application of any precursor retinoids may result in biological effects. however, the potency of the retinoid is strongly dependent on its metabolic distance to retinoic acid. hence, the retinoidlike activity after topical application increases in the following order: retinyl esters << retinol < retinal < retinoic acid. the retinoids retinyl esters, retinol and retinal are used in a large variety of cosmetic products such as anti-wrinkle creams, body lotions, hand creams and sunscreens. as active ingredients they are expected to provide the cosmetic product with a series of specific abilities to improve and counteract skin aging and photoaging, prevent oxidative stress, and control cutaneous bacterial flora. although retinyl esters did not show significant anti-aging activity, the retinyl ester - retinyl palmitate - is widely used in cosmetics because of its stability. with respect to sunscreen products, retinyl palmitate is extensively used because of its antioxidant, stabilising properties. however, in Europe and the USA, retinyl palmitate is not allowed to be added as UV-filter as such (VKM, 2012). several studies have demonstrated that topical retinol may induce the same cellular and molecular changes as retinoic acid although a 20 times higher dose is needed and the local irritation characteristics are less prominent. it has been shown that retinol could be effective in the treatment of skin aging and photoaging, but the effect was dependent on the vehicle used, as retinol is unstable and easily gets degraded to biologically inactive forms when exposed to light and air (VKM, 2012). in several studies it has been demonstrated that retinal may be a useful topical agent in the treatment of aged and photoaged skin. various cosmetic products containing retinal, primarily anti-aging preparations, are available on the European market. based on information provided by cosmetic industry, vitamin A and esters are not used for children in the EU.

Submission I for cetylpyridinium chloride was submitted in march 2005. The SCCP concluded (SCCP/0985/06) that in view of the poor quality of the toxicological data presented in the submitted dossier a new dossier should be submitted with data on all relevant toxicological end-points and conforming to currently accepted standards. Submission II for cetylpyridinium chloride was submitted in July 2011. Submission II is almost identical to submission I, i.e. submission II consists mainly of the same references as submission I with many of the pdf files being of poor quality (including incomplete pages, handwritten notes) that makes reading very difficult. Submission II is supplemented with a separate submission by a company (called Company Submission in this opinion) in 2011 to the European Chemicals Agency (echa) for use as a biocide. In contrast to submission II (and submission I) the company submission includes studies on acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity, skin and eye irritation, and skin sensitisation, which have been performed according to currently accepted test guidelines. Two genotoxicity studies (in vitro mouse lymphoma test and in vitro chromosome aberration test) performed according to currently accepted test guidelines are included in submission II (and submission I). The company submission also includes an in vivo micronucleus study. The studies in the company submission on repeated dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and on adme are identical to those in submission II (and submission I). No studies have been included in the company submission regarding carcinogenicity and dermal absorption, but a justification for non-submission of data has been provided. The EFSA panel on food contact materials, enzymes, flavourings and processing aids (cef panel) has recently published a scientific opinion on the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of Cecure® for the removal of microbial surface contamination of raw poultry products (ref.: 24).

The EFSA panel noted that this value is only applicable if other uses of resorcinol are excluded. it is included in Annex I as an existing active substance in biocidal products in accordance with the requirements of article 3(1) of commission regulation (EC) 1451/2007 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market.

Extended use of ≥2% hydroquinone, topically applied, has been associated with adverse effects including exogenous ochronosis in dark-skinned people. hydroquinone, like β-arbutin, is present in many dietary components in trace amounts and is metabolised in vivo to its glucuronide and sulphate conjugates. β-arbutin is proposed to be used as a skin-lightening agent in cosmetic face creams or face lotions at concentrations up to 7%." ;

dissolved in 10% ethanol and water. light Source - a white fluorescent lamp and near ultraviolet lamp. procedure - Samples were kept in transparent glass bottle of 50mL. protected samples wrapped in aluminium foil were used as controls. samples were exposed to light providing an overall illumination of no less than 1.2 million lux hours and an integrated near ultraviolet energy of no less than 200 w·h/m2 at 25°C then measured instantly in compliance with ICH guidelines, the analysis being repeated 3 times for each lot of product, using an HPLC assay with detection at 280 nm. the quantitation limit of HQ in the samples was 1 ppm. conclusion:no apparent change in the amount of β-arbutin was observed between light-exposed and control samples. a slight increase of hydroquinone, on the other hand, was observed in lightexposed 6.3% solutions although those levels were always below 2.5 ppm after light exposure. photostability at different pH values and temperatures (Test date 2008-9) sample type: 7% β-arbutin in phosphate buffers ranging from pH 2.0-11.0, samples prepared from Lot TTG-305 were subdivided and kept in transparent glass bottles (30ml). protected samples wrapped in aluminium foil were used as dark controls. samples were exposed to light (white fluorescent lamp) providing an overall illumination of no less than 1.2 million lux hours and an integrated near ultraviolet energy of no less than 200 w･h/m2 at 25ο (ICH guidelines). the effects of temperature were studied at 50°C for 1 month and 40°C for 3 months. the analyses were repeated 3 times for each lot of product. the authors concluded that for both the heat and light conditions, no apparent change on the amount of β-arbutin was observed at pH 4-11. β-arbutin levels were slightly decreased at pH ≤3 accompanied by a rapid increase of hydroquinone. the degree of hydroquinone generation was higher at low pH (~4,300ppm at 50°C 1 month and 3,700ppm at 40°C 3 months at pH 2); however only trace levels of hydroquinone were detected in neutral to basic solutions (pH 6-11). in a cosmetic formulation: accelerated test conditions for 6 months/ date of study: 2008-2009/method: Internal protocol Shiseido Co, Japan/test substance: Shiseido product C (Lot 0804A, B, C) containing 5.67-6.93% β-arbutin at pH 5.0-7.0/temperature: 40°C/relative humidity 75%/analytical method: HPLC/ samples were kept in a transparent glass bottle at 40°C and 75% relative humidity for 6 months. β-arbutin and hydroquinone concentrations were measured in threefold by HPLC for each batch at the start of the study, after 3 months and after 6 months. conclusions:  since the concentrations of β-arbutin were stable and those of hydroquinone remained below 1 ppm (detection limit), the study authors conclude that β-arbutin is stable in final cosmetic formulations and that no hydroquinone is released under accelerated ageing conditions for 6 months. ambient test conditions for 36 months, i.e.,long-term testing/date of study: 2003-6/method: internal protocol Shiseido Co, Japan/test substance: Shiseido product C (lot A, B, C) containing 5.67-6.93% β-arbutin (pH5.0-7.0)/temperature: 25°C/relative humidity: 60%/analytical method: HPLC/ samples of Shiseido product C were kept in a transparent glass bottle at ambient conditions for 3 years. β-arbutin and hydroquinone concentrations were measured in threefold by HPLC at the start and at the end of the study. since the concentrations of β-arbutin were stable and those of hydroquinone remained below 1 ppm (detection limit), the study authors conclude that β-arbutin is stable in the usual cosmetic formulation and that no hydroquinone is released under normal storage conditions for 3 years. overall conclusion:  β-arbutin is stable in final cosmetic formulations, hydroquinone content in the finished product was no more than 1 ppm (LLOQ) throughout the accelerated and longterm storage conditions (40°C, 75% relative humidity for 6 months and (25°C, 60% relative humidity for 36 months). β-arbutin was relatively stable to light when dissolved in a 10% ethanol aqueous solution. no significant change in the amount of β-arbutin was detected and only trace levels of hydroquinone (<0.25 ppm) were detected under the conditions of the ICH photostability test. β-arbutin was found to be unstable in low pH solutions, decrease of β-arbutin and significant increase of hydroquinone was observed, especially at pH 2. a recently published study(Yang CH et al. 2013) tested ß-arbutin (and deoxy-arbutin) at 10^-4 M (<0.003 % w/v) in aqueous solution with 10% propylene glycol and UV irradiation (narrow band UVB lightunit at 312 nm) at 2.65 mW/cm2: under these conditions (pH not given), ß-arbutin wasreduced to 43.5% of the initial level after 2 h of irradiation, and hydroquinone was detectedat significant levels (up to 20%) over the test period (up to 12 h). SCCS comment: as the test concentration is far below that used in cosmetic products, this study, Yang CH et al. is considered to be of limited relevance. the results presented in the respective studies regarding photostability testing (according to ICH guideline) and pH- or temperature-dependent stabilities of β-arbutin sound conclusive and reliable. In cosmetic formulations hydroquinone as impurity remained below 1 ppm (detection limit). yet, aside from reduced photostability under certain UV irradiation conditions (Yang et al. 2013), it is to be considered that β-arbutin may also undergo cutaneous hydrolysis into hydroquinone due to enzymatic activity through β-glucosidases in skin (Mier & van den Hurk 1976; Redoules et al. 2005) or via the activity of microbes residing on the surface of the skin (Bang et al. 2008).

SCCS comments: percentage content of all of the impurities should be calculated at λmax = 246 nm of the test substance. quantitative determination of R0011102A (p-phenylenediamine) content by HPLC was carried out at 240 nm. to prove that the filtration does not interfere with the analysis of the test substance and impurities, a chromatogram obtained from the analysis of the sample before the filtration should be compared (“% area and retention times” of A166 and impurities, number of impurities) to a chromatogram obtained from the analysis of the same sample after filtration and under the same chromatographic conditions. during commenting period, in appendix 1, the applicant has two assays conducted before and after the filtration of the sample, under the same chromatographic conditions showing that the % area of the main product and impurities are comparable in these two assays. SCCS underlines that applicant should have clearly indicated which of the two assays have been conducted before or after filtration. considering MoS calculation based on added information provided by applicant during the public consultation period (i.e. NOAEL value of 200 mg/kg/day (NOAEL obtained in the 28- day oral toxicity study in rats – OECD 407 (1999)), SCCS agrees on the fact that the presence of the impurity 3-aminopropyl imidazole at a maximum level of 0.1% in methylimidazoliumpropyl p-phenylenediamine, Cl, 2HCl (A166) presents no or a negligible risk to human health. considering complementary information provided by applicant during the public consultation period, the exposure to the impurity chloroethane to be considered is equal to 100 microgram per day which is below the NSRL of 150 microgram/day. in addition, such an exposure of 100 microgram / day is far below the virtual safe dose (996 microgram/day) calculated based on the LTD10 with a MoE of 10000. SCCS agrees that the presence of the impurity chloroethane at a maximum level of 0.05% in methylimidazoliumpropyl pphenylenediamine, Cl, 2HCl (A166) is unlikely to present a risk to human health. one of the impurities, 4-aminophenylamine dihydrochloride (synonym p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride), has already been the subject of an SCCS opinion (SCCS/1443/11 revision of 18 september 2012), which raised concerns over its strong skin sensitising potency. the solubility was measured in water only. this study was conducted in compliance with: - OECD guideline for the testing of chemicals: N° 105 - water solubility adopted July 27, 1995. - OECD principles of good laboratory practice. test material batch R0027494A 008 L 002 (99.9% pure) was used in this study. a preliminary test for the water solubility was carried out. the water solubility of the test item was estimated to be greater than 1 kg/L in pure water at room temperature (20°C ± 5°C). at this high level of solubility, no pH-dependency could be observed. based on the guideline the shake flask method was used for the test performance for substances with solubility > 10 mg/L. test principle shake flask method the closed vessels containing (5 g test item, 1 ml solvent) were incubated in a shaking water bath at 30 °C for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively. soon after the start of the preincubation time, the samples appeared as deep dark brown solution with colourless crystals of 2-5 mm size inside. at the end of each incubation period the vessels were removed from the water bath and equilibrated for another 24 hours at 20 °C under shaking. the remaining test item was separated by filtration through a 0.45 μm syringe tip filter and analysed by HPLC / UV. the results showed no tendency to change over time and met all validity criteria, therefore the study is considered to be valid. based on the analyses, the solubility of the test item in water was determined to be 931 g/L at 20 °C. the determination of the concentration in the saturated solutions was done under usage of a quadratic regression. the arrangements made to prevent a possible oxidation of the test item (overlay with argon, addition of ascorbic acid in the solvent) seem to be sufficient. ref : Wöhr T.

(2013), toner F. (2014). SCCS comment. the information provided on stability of A166 is not convincing. the use of ascorbic acid and argon for the shaking flask method, and the storage conditions (4 ± 4 °C, in the dark under argon), indicates that the test substance is easily oxidised. the applicant has provided further information on the stability studies performed for the dose formulation used for toxicity studies, where the dissolution media is distilled water. however, details on the solvent media and the procedure used for preparation of solutions are not fully described in the report. it is necessary to provide data on the stability of A166 under conditions of use with a selective analytical method. liquid scintillation counting is not a selective method for this purpose. the stability study was performed before mixing the test substance with the developer, whereas it should be performed after the mixing with the developer. any degradation products should also be chemically characterised. any degradation products should be chemically characterised.

Chemical characterisation was performed by UV, FTIR and 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy on the batches 1442/3+4 and C-1701/8. The 13C-spectra showed the expected signals for the given structure. The 1H-NMR results, however, showed the presence of an isomeric mixture. The non-GLP results obtained from different NMR experiments revealed a time- dependent isomerisation of the test item (Z-isomer) to the corresponding E-isomer upon dissolution. The time-dependent investigation yielded equilibrium after ca. 5 hours of an isomeric mixture with a ratio of 1.98: 1.00 for Z-isomer to E-isomer. The UV filter C-1701 B_C_3 is synthesised as Z-isomer and upon dissolution it isomerises within 5 hours to approximately 60% Z-isomer and ca. 40% E-isomer. Purity of UV filter C-1701 B_C_3 was determined by quantitative 1H-NMR spectroscopy with internal standard on the batches 1442/3+4 and C-1701/8.

GC-MS quantitation of the impurities should also be provided based on the GC-MS data presented in the report. hydroquinone content should be accurately quantified in each batch and be at unavoidable trace level in each batch. stability of 1,2,4-THB in solution depends on the amount of dissolved oxygen in the solution. if the solution has been thoroughly degassed and is stored in an inert atmosphere or in a sealed container, the material will be stable until oxygen exposure is allowed. once oxygen is available, the molecule will undergo oxidation and condense with itself to form dimers and oligomers in the absence of primary intermediates. Black particulate matter of high molecular weight precipitates out of the solution and settles to the bottom. in view of the reactivity of 1,2,4-THB with oxygen, these hair dye formulations are filled into specialised, oxygen-barrier packaging for commercialisation. stability tests are conducted under standard conditions (both room and elevated temperature) appropriate for cosmetic products. final product stability meets standard requirements until the package is opened by the consumer for use. upon dispensing and application, the combination of dyes (including 1,2,4-THB and precursors) in the formulation undergo oxidative reactions as is predicted by their chemical structure. stability of 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene in typical hair dye formulations was not reported except the reaction of 1,2,4-THB in the presence of the primary intermediate PTD (A5), which was studied as a representative example of oxidative coupling with primary intermediates in general. in response to the request for clarification from the SCCS on uses of 1,2,4-THB, the applicant confirmed that 1,2,4-THB is intended to be used in the presence of primary intermediates such as p-phenylenediamine (A7), p-toluenediamine (PTD)(A5), N,N bis–(2-hydroxyethyl) pphenylenediamine (A50) and p-aminophenol (A16), just to name a few. this is done to achieve a range of desired permanent colours, and the particular primary intermediate or combination thereof will depend on the desired shade. it was also confirmed that the only study conducted in the presence of a primary intermediate was the dermal absorption work, which evaluated dermal absorption with the 1,2,4-THB in a simple formulation with PTD (A5).

One-generation reproduction toxicity: stability, homogeneity and content of the solutions of hc red n° 13 in the vehicle were analytically confirmed. dosing solutions were prepared once per week as stability in the vehicle for up to 7 days could be demonstrated. the mean concentrations of the test samples were 98 and 103%, 99.9 and 101.6% as well as 100.4 and 99.2% of the nominal values for the three dose groups analysed twice at the beginning and at the end of the administration period. these values confirmed proper dosing for the entire study period. the slight variation (-2 to 1%) noted for the three samples taken from each dosing solution demonstrates the homogeneity of the test solutions used. Teratogenicity study: stability, homogeneity and content of the solutions of hc red n° 13 were analytically confirmed. dosing solutions were prepared once per week as stability in the vehicle for up to 7 days could be demonstrated. the mean recovery rates of the test samples were 95.4 and 98.4%, 98.6 and 97.6% as well as 98.7 and 96.7% of the nominal values for the low, mid and high dose groups, respectively, analysed twice at the beginning and at the end of the administration period. these values confirmed proper dosing for the entire study period. stability under oxidative conditions: the stability of the dyestuff kardinalrot in a 1:1 mixture of a crème formulation (formula no. 81207116) and hydrogen peroxide 6% (welloxon 6%) was examined by means of hplc. the recoveries of the dyestuff determined after 15 min, 30 min and 45 min were 93.8%, 93.3% and 90.8% respectively. the sccs considers a decrease below 10% as not significant due to uncertainties connected with the analytical measurements.

Lysmeral®extra is prevented from auto-oxidating to the corresponding acid by alpha- tocopherol, which is present in the final product at 200 ppm (references: BASF 2016, 2017 SMII: 5, 6, 35). the shelf life of Lysmeral®extra is 730 days at 25°C (references: BASF 1998 SMII: 34).

This is a consequence of the high pH value of oxidative hair coloring products (typically of about 9-10), which is significantly higher than the pKa values of hydroxypropyl pphenylenediamine (2.9 and 6.1 for each of the two amine functions of a165). accordingly, only hydroxypropyl p-phenylenediamine (free base) is present in oxidative hair coloring products containing the hair dye ingredient a165, whatever the initial form (salt or free base) of the ingredient used to formulate the product." ;
