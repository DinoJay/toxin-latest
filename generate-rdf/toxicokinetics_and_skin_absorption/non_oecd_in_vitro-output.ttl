Glucuronidation and sulfation of triclosan were demonstrated to occur in this model (i.e., the conjugates were found in the collecting reservoir following absorption through the skin), with the glucuronide being the primary metabolite at levels up to 1.4%. 3 H-labelled triclosan has been used to examine percutaneous absorption in a number of in vitro studies. Percutaneous penetration of 30.3% of the total applied dose of triclosan in an ethanol/water solution was measured 24 hours after application of the dose to human skin samples in a diffusion cell system [Moss et al., 2000 (21)]. Results from studies using skin samples in diffusion cells showed limited percutaneous absorption following application of triclosan to the skin surface in any of the formulations used. The amount of triclosan tested in most of these studies (0.2%) is within the range of anticipated concentrations in consumer products (from 0.15 to 0.3%). The low concentration in the soap solution study (0.02%) was intended to simulate actual-use conditions (i.e., a soap solution of 0.2% triclosan would be diluted with water when applied to the skin). Appropriate rinse steps were included in the rinse-off product studies. As recommended by SCCP guidelines (SCCP, 2006), calculations of dermal absorption included the amounts of triclosan recovered in the dermis and epidermis layers (i.e., the “remaining sample of skin” after removing the stratum corneum, represented by tape strips 1 to 20 in these studies) and the amount recovered in the receptor fluid. Table 37 presents a summary of the values from the in vitro studies conducted in human skin samples. The results from the autoradiography study [Black et al., 1975 (27)] indicated no significant differences in the low levels of percutaneous absorption between different soap vehicles or between single versus multiple applications [Black et al., 1975 (27)]. Overall, the dermal absorption of triclosan was shown in these in vitro studies to be lower in human skin than in rat (7.2 to 30.3% versus 41.2% in studies in rats, including the data from the study using ethanol/water formulation)].

The type of formulation does not appear to significantly influence the dermal absorption. Most of the absorbed DHA was found within the dermis/epidermis compartment. The fact that DHA does not appear to covalently bind to skin proteins is quite surprising, as the brown staining of the skin does not disappear for hours after application. Therefore the study authors conclude that DHA probably binds to and/or interacts with skin constituents in a manner that consists of a combination of covalent and other intermediate chemical bond forms." ;

        ont:discussion_and_result    "[14C]-BMHCA was intensively converted into 9 main metabolites by microsomes (8 by hepatocytes). All metabolites separated by HPLC were more hydrophilic than the parent compound. Metabolism can be summarised as follows (according to CLH report, BASF 2013): In liver microsomes, oxidation or reduction of BMHCA to the corresponding acid (lysmerylic acid, M7) or alcohol (lysmersol, M9), the latter being further oxidised at its tert-butyl group (to yield M3), was observed. In hepatocytes, as dehydrogenation follow-up product of M7 (E)-3-(4-t-butyl-phenyl)-2-methyl-acrylic acid (M16) was observed. Further, p-t-butylbenzoic acid (TBBA, M15) and its glycine conjugate (p-t-butyl-hippuric acid; TBHA, M12) occurred in rodents. In addition to these metabolites, glucuronic acid conjugates of M3, M7, M9 and M16 were detected. Lysmerylic acid (M7) was the main metabolite in hepatocytes of all species. Significant species differences in metabolic profiles were noted for TBHA (M12; 4.9 – 27.1% in mice, 3.5 – 3.6% in rats, not in rabbits or humans) and TBBA (M15). Among the species tested, rat hepatocytes formed the highest amounts of TBBA (M15; 8.3 – 29.3% in rats, 1.9 – 7.5% in humans, ≤0.5% in mice, ≤2.0% in rabbits)." ;

Given its physicochemical properties, BMHCA is likely to have high bioavailability via the oral route. After oral and dermal administration to experimental animals and humans (cf. section 3.3.4.2.), there is clear evidence of systemic absorption of BMHCA. However, in humans compared to rats, only limited percutaneous absorption of BMHCA (in EtOH) could be observed in vivo (1.4% vs. 19%). Species-specific differences in the metabolism of BMHCA have been identified both in vitro and in vivo. Lysmerylic acid was the main hepatic metabolite in all species tested. Quantitative evaluation of metabolic profiles for different species in an in vitro metabolism study demonstrated much higher levels of TBBA formation by rat hepatocytes when compared to other species. In particular, TBBA levels observed in human hepatocytes were about 4-fold lower compared to rat hepatocytes at corresponding concentrations. Comparative assessment of the urinary metabolites in different animal species again uncovered differences in the urinary excretion of TBBA (and TBHA), with rats being the species that predominantly forms TBBA. However, the differences observed between rats and monkeys did not mirror the 4-fold difference in TBBA formation as seen with rat and human liver microsomes in vitro." ;

During Meetings of the Commission Working Group on the Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Substances it has been stated several times that human skin absorption is less than 0.3%, but may be higher in damaged skin. In the SCCNFP Opinion concerning boric acid, borates and tetraborates adopted 23 September 1998 (SCCNFP/0024/98) the percutaneous absorption was considered to be about 0.2%. The SCCS considers that the available measurements of dermal absorption have a significant degree of uncertainty. Therefore an absorption of 0.5% will be used in the safety evaluation for the boric compounds discussed in this Opinion (representing the absorption of boric acid + 2 x SD [0.23 + 2 x 0.13%] from the study of Wester et al., 1998). This is in agreement with other recent risk assessment of borates in EU (EU, 2009a, ECHA, 2010). It should be noted that skin absorption is probably higher in case of damaged skin. The dermal absorption of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was slightly lower than that for the other boron compounds, however the octaborate was applied at a higher concentration, and the percentage of absorption would probably be higher if lower concentrations had been used. Absorption for oral and inhalation routes are assumed to be 100% (ECHA, 2010)" ;

        ont:scss_comment_to_test     "sccs conclusion on dermal/percutaneous absorption: dermal absorption studies in vitro demonstrated species-specific effects. the bioavailable portion was found much higher in rats (66.1 and 50.8%) when compared to mini pigs (0.8% and 4.9%), thereby depending on the solvent used (methylcarbitol or ethanol). in a second study, applying two real cream formulations (that contained 0.6% bmhca), rat skin again allowed a much higher penetration (45.2% and 78.4%) than mini pig skin (23.6% and 25.7%). nevertheless, the fraction of bioavailable bmhca was found strongly increased in the mini pig experiment when moving from dissolved bmhca to real cream formulations (4.9% vs. 25.7%). concurrently, administration of bmhca onto the skin of experimental animals and humans demonstrated permeation and systemic availability of this compound. percutaneous absorption of bmhca in humans was lower when compared with rats (1.4 vs. 19%). upon dermal application of [14c]-bmhca (11.37 mg test substance in 70% ethanol on 10 cm2 back skin) on 3 human volunteers for 6 hours, a mean of 1.4% (range 0.8 – 2.4%) of the applied dose was excreted in urine within 24 hours, whereas radioactivity was below the detection limit in urine samples of later time points and in all faeces and blood plasma samples. the overall mean total recovery of topical application of [14c]-bmhca was 71 ± 10%. in comparison to the in vitro observations, the absorption rate found in humans for ethanolic solutions of bmhca was comparable to what has been found in excised mini pig skin. given that the absorption of bmhca in mini pig skin was much higher when this compound was applied via real cream formulations, it is reasonable to conclude that bmhca might also better penetrate human skin when it is applied in cream formulations. since there is no further experimental data on this subject, the sccs concludes that the maximum fraction of bmhca being absorbed by human skin might be in the range of 25% rather than at 2.4%. in consideration of the comparability of pig skin with human skin, the dermal bioavailability of ethanolic (dissolved) bmhca to be used in the calculation of the systemic exposure dose (sed) and margin of safety (mos) will be set at 5% (worst case scenario based on 1% bmhca in etoh applied at 120 μg substance/cm2 onto 5 cm2 excised mini pig skin; result: total of 5.87 μg substance/cm2 found in stripped skin and chamber fluid after 16 hrs of exposure). on the other hand, the penetration rate of bmhca applied onto the skin as ingredient of creamy formulations will be set at 25% (worst case scenario based on 36 μg substance/cm2 applied onto 5 cm2 excised mini pig skin; mean out of two experiments: total of 8.88 μg substance/cm2 found in stripped skin and chamber fluid after 16 hrs of exposure). the sccs is aware of the issue that the exact identity of the cream formulations applied in the latter study remains obscure. the results obtained from the part of the study with 1% ethanolic bmhca can further be used to assess the sed for hydroalcoholic products to be applied on a defined surface area of shaved or unshaved skin once daily (1 x 305 cm2/day). here, an absorption of about 6 μg substance/cm2 can be assumed for unshaved skin (stratum corneum intact). for shaved skin (stratum corneum compromised), however, the total absorption would be 11 μg substance/cm2 (with the addition of the portion of 4.66 μg/cm2 that was found sticking in the stratum corneum in the respective experiment; cf. above).

The permeability figures for the reference substances propranolol (Papp = 58.2 and 48.0 x 10-6 cm/sec), a high permeability reference compound with 90 % absorption in humans, and ranitidine (Papp = 0.2 and <0.1 x 10-6 cm/sec), known to be absorbed at about 50 % in humans, were within acceptance range of 20 - 60 x 10-6 cm/sec and 0.0 - 2 x 10-6 cm/sec, respectively and demonstrated the validity of the assay." ;
