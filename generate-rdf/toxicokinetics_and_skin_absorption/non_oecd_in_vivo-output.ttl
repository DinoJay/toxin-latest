        ont:SCCS_comment_to_test  "No dermal absorption studies have been performed according to modern guidelines. During Meetings of the Commission Working Group on the Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Substances it has been stated several times that human skin absorption is less than 0.3%, but may be higher in damaged skin. In the SCCNFP Opinion concerning boric acid, borates and tetraborates adopted 23 September 1998 (SCCNFP/0024/98) the percutaneous absorption was considered to be about 0.2%. The SCCS considers that the available measurements of dermal absorption have a significant degree of uncertainty. Therefore an absorption of 0.5% will be used in the safety evaluation for the boric compounds discussed in this Opinion (representing the absorption of boric acid + 2 x SD [0.23 + 2 x 0.13%] from the study of Wester et al., 1998). This is in agreement with other recent risk assessment of borates in EU (EU, 2009a, ECHA, 2010). It should be noted that skin absorption is probably higher in case of damaged skin. The dermal absorption of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was slightly lower than that for the other boron compounds, however the octaborate was applied at a higher concentration, and the percentage of absorption would probably be higher if lower concentrations had been used. Absorption for oral and inhalation routes are assumed to be 100% (ECHA, 2010)" ;

Additional studies were conducted to determine blood and urine levels of triclosan (as a measure of absorption) following single and multiple percutaneous applications of triclosan in different vehicles including soaps, creams, other skin cleansers and surgical scrubs. Together, these data support findings indicating that percutaneous triclosan absorption is minimal [Caudal et al., 1974 (125); Thompson et al., 1975a (127); Hong et al., 1976 (24)]. In general, blood levels of triclosan increased immediately after percutaneous application [Ciba-Geigy, 1972a (119); Ciba-Geigy, 1972b (124)], were enhanced by the presence of an occlusive dressing [Thompson et al., 1975b (128)], and were proportional to the dose applied [Ciba-Geigy, 1973b (120)]. Percutaneous absorption of triclosan from the use of BK85triclosan-containing soap, underarm product and talc was also shown to be detectable in subjects already using triclosan-containing toothpaste [BIBRA International, 1988 (137); Beiswanger and Tuohy, 1990 (138)]. The predominant route of excretion following percutaneous application of triclosan is the urine (2 to 14% of the applied dose) [Stierlin, 1972b (121); Caudal et al., 1974 (125); Thompson et al., 1975b (128)], with much smaller amounts appearing in the faeces (0.5 to 2% of the applied dose) [Stierlin, 1972b (121)]. Excretion data revealed that, following single and multiple applications (2 to 3 times/day for 45 days), all the triclosan appearing inthe urine was present as the glucuronide conjugate [Wagner and Leshar, 1977 (139); Caudal et al., 1974 (125)], whereas the majority of the faecal triclosan was present as the free unchanged compound [Wagner and Leshar, 1977 (139)].

Additional female rats were dosed with neat 14C-D5 and 14C-D5 in simethicone fluid to evaluate any effect that the carrier may have on the absorption and disposition of D5 following oral administration. Animals (n = 4/sex and n = 4 females/carrier) were housed in glass metabolism cages for collection of urine, faeces and expired volatiles. At 168 h post-dose, animals were sacrificed and selected tissues and remaining carcasses were collected. All samples were analyzed for radioactivity content. In addition to radioactivity, feces and expired volatiles were analyzed for parent D5 concentration. A separate group of jugular vein cannulated animals (n = 6/sex and n = 6 females/carrier) were used to determine radioactivity and parent D5 concentration in blood at 15 min, 1, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h post dosing. Whole body autoradiography (WBA) was used for qualitative in vivo assessment of tissue distribution of radioactivity in male and female rats following a single oral administration of 14C-D5 in corn oil. Rats in the WBA groups were sacrificed at 3, 12, 24, 49, 96 and 168 h post-dose. The majority of administered dose, regardless of sex or carrier, was excreted in faeces. The absorption of D5 based on radioactivity recovered in urine, expired volatiles, expired CO2, tissues and carcass in males and females dosed with 14C-D5 in corn oil was 21.82 and 19.62% of administered dose respectively. Both sexes showed similar patterns of disposition (urine: 4.70 and 4.37%; expired volatiles: 13.36 and 10.37%; expired C02: 0.92 and 0.97%; tissues: 0.38 and 0.49%; carcass: 2.46 and 3.43% for males and females, respectively). Qualitative assessment of tissue distribution (WBA) showed that the radioactivity was systematically available and distributed to major organs such as bone marrow, liver, kidney, and fat. Statistical analysis of blood curves showed significant difference between radioactivity and parent area under the curves (AUC) for both males and females when 14C-D5 was administrated in corn oil indicating presence of metabolites in the blood. Absorption of D5 was also compared between various carriers. Data obtained from the blood curve analysis showed that the test article was most readily absorbed when delivered in corn oil and least available for absorption when carried in the simethicone fluid The mass balanced data showed that 19.62%, 25.81% and 9.94% of administered 14C-D5 was absorbed when delivered in corn oil, in simethicone fluid or as neat 14C-D5 respectively. The majority of the absorbed dose was found in expired volatile traps particularly when the dose was delivered in simethicone fluid. The entire radioactivity expired was attributed to the parent compound. The discrepancy between absorption assessed by blood curve analysis and mass balance data analysis may be caused by evaporation of 14C-D5 from the excreted fecal matter that remained in the bottom of the cage. Animals dosed with corn oil and especially simethicone had a higher occurrence of loose fecal matter that adhered to the side of the cages. HPLC profile evaluation of urine and faeces showed that the entire radioactivity in the urine consisted of polar metabolites, whereas in the faeces, the majority was parent D5 with a trace of non-polar metabolite." ;

Percutaneous absorption of triclosan from the use of triclosan-containing soap, underarm product and talc was also shown to be detectable in subjects already using triclosan-containing toothpaste [BIBRA International, 1988 (137); Beiswanger and Tuohy, 1990 (138)]. Two studies comparing oral exposure to triclosan-containing toothpaste alone and in combination with percutaneously applied triclosan-containing products (e.g., soap, talc, anti-perspirant/underarm deodorant) revealed that, in each study and for both groups, circulating metabolites were composed primarily of glucuronide for the duration of the study (8 and 13 weeks) [BIBRA International, 1988 (137); Beiswanger and Tuohy, 1990 (138)]. Plasma concentrations of total triclosan generally did not exceed 100 ng/mL in the 8-week study and ranged from approximately 20 to 30 ng/mL in the 13-week study. In the 13-week study [Beiswanger and Tuohy, 1990 (138)], the group receiving oral plus percutaneous exposure had increased blood levels of total triclosan and glucuronide-conjugated triclosan (approximately 24 to 30 and 26 to 29 ng/mL, respectively) compared with the group receiving oral exposure only (approximately 19 to 22 and 19 to 21 ng/mL, respectively) throughout the study (Weeks 3, 6, and 13). In summary, the relative ratio of glucuronide to sulphate conjugates alters with repeat dosing (i.e., as plasma steady-state triclosan levels are reached) versus single dosing. Generally, lower plasma concentrations of total triclosan are associated with glucuronide conjugates as the predominant metabolite. With increasing plasma levels of total triclosan, there is an increase in circulating sulphate conjugates, which can reach levels greater than those attained by glucuronide conjugates, given high enough plasma levels of total triclosan." ;

The SCCS agrees with the conclusion of the sccp and therefore, the submitted toxicokinetic studies have not been evaluated by the sccs in this opinion. Overall SCCS conclusion on oral absorption based on the toxicokinetic studies: As the toxicokinetic studies could not be evaluated by the SCCS (see the SCCS comments above), the oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride from mouthwashes, cosmetic products containing up to 0.1% cetylpyridinium chloride or from all other oral hygiene cosmetic products containing up to 0.5% (w/w) cetylpyridinium chloride cannot be estimated. According to the notes of guidance, 50% oral absorption is used in case inadequate data on oral absorption are available. However, if there is evidence to suggest poor oral bioavailability, it may be more appropriate to assume that only 10% of the administered dose is systemically available. From the submitted oral toxicokinetic study in rats, the oral absorption was estimated to be approximately 14% following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage. However, in another study with intravenous injection of 2.5 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose to rats, the major part of applied radioactivity was excreted in urine and faeces in similar amounts. The latter study indicates that biliary excretion of cetylpyridinium chloride takes place in rats and therefore, the estimate of 14% absorption following oral administration based on faecal excretion in the oral rat study is not supported by the intravenous rat study. In one of the submitted oral toxicokinetic studies in dogs, 10-15% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage, whereas in the other submitted oral toxicokinetic studies in dogs, 22% of the radioactivity was reported to be excreted in the urine, also following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage. however, the low recovery of the radioactivity in these studies is a major drawback for the interpretation of the results in both studies. Overall, the available oral toxicokinetic data indicate an oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride of higher than 10% in both rats and dogs. Therefore, an oral absorption of 50% is used in the safety assessment for the calculation of the margin of safety (MoS)." ;

In the mouse, levels of triclosan in liver were higher than plasma following longterm repeated dosing. in the 90-day study, only the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates were detected in blood samples, the glucuronide predominating in the early blood samples (days 1 to 2), and triclosan sulfate predominating in all subsequent blood samples (samples were taken daily for the 90-day duration of the study). triclosan was excreted in the urine primarily as the glucuronide conjugate, but was excreted in the faeces primarily in the free or unconjugated form. low levels of triclosan were detected in tissues. the results of this monkey study indicate that triclosan was absorbed percutaneously following 90 days of daily washing with 15 mL of soap (1 mg triclosan/mL) and that the proportion of plasma glucuronide and sulphate conjugates altered following chronic administration.

During Meetings of the Commission Working Group on the Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Substances it has been stated several times that human skin absorption is less than 0.3%, but may be higher in damaged skin. In the SCCNFP Opinion concerning boric acid, borates and tetraborates adopted 23 September 1998 (SCCNFP/0024/98) the percutaneous absorption was considered to be about 0.2%. The SCCS considers that the available measurements of dermal absorption have a significant degree of uncertainty. Therefore an absorption of 0.5% will be used in the safety evaluation for the boric compounds discussed in this Opinion (representing the absorption of boric acid + 2 x SD [0.23 + 2 x 0.13%] from the study of Wester et al., 1998). This is in agreement with other recent risk assessment of borates in EU (EU, 2009a, ECHA, 2010). It should be noted that skin absorption is probably higher in case of damaged skin. The dermal absorption of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was slightly lower than that for the other boron compounds, however the octaborate was applied at a higher concentration, and the percentage of absorption would probably be higher if lower concentrations had been used. Absorption for oral and inhalation routes are assumed to be 100% (ECHA, 2010)" ;

Infant exposure to triclosan from breast milk has been shown to be significantly lower than exposure to the mother, based on a comparison of triclosan concentrations in breast milk and plasma [Allmyr et al., 2006 (103)]. No measured exposure data for babies and young children following use of consumer products containing triclosan was identified in the literature, except spot urine measurements in the age group 6-11 years from the NHANES study [Calafat et al. 2008; AR3]. Based on the conversion of spot urine concentrations to estimated dose, this subpopulation had a lower aggregate exposure to triclosan than children of 11-19 years and adults [US EPA 2008 (AR9)]. The rapid increase in maturation of glucuronidation ability within the first year and the maturity of the sulfation pathway, indicate that capabilities of children to metabolise triclosan through glucuronidation or sulfation are likely comparable to those of adults. Also, glomerular filtration rates normalised to body weight approach adult values by around 6 months of age and renal tubular function matures to near-adult values by around 1 year of age (Alcorn and McNamara, 2002). Accordingly, studies have shown that elimination is comparable in adults and children." ;

The SCCS agrees with the conclusion of the sccp and therefore, the submitted toxicokinetic studies have not been evaluated by the sccs in this opinion. Overall SCCS conclusion on oral absorption based on the toxicokinetic studies: As the toxicokinetic studies could not be evaluated by the SCCS (see the SCCS comments above), the oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride from mouthwashes, cosmetic products containing up to 0.1% cetylpyridinium chloride or from all other oral hygiene cosmetic products containing up to 0.5% (w/w) cetylpyridinium chloride cannot be estimated. According to the notes of guidance, 50% oral absorption is used in case inadequate data on oral absorption are available. However, if there is evidence to suggest poor oral bioavailability, it may be more appropriate to assume that only 10% of the administered dose is systemically available. From the submitted oral toxicokinetic study in rats, the oral absorption was estimated to be approximately 14% following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage. However, in another study with intravenous injection of 2.5 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose to rats, the major part of applied radioactivity was excreted in urine and faeces in similar amounts. The latter study indicates that biliary excretion of cetylpyridinium chloride takes place in rats and therefore, the estimate of 14% absorption following oral administration based on faecal excretion in the oral rat study is not supported by the intravenous rat study. In one of the submitted oral toxicokinetic studies in dogs, 10-15% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage, whereas in the other submitted oral toxicokinetic studies in dogs, 22% of the radioactivity was reported to be excreted in the urine, also following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage. however, the low recovery of the radioactivity in these studies is a major drawback for the interpretation of the results in both studies. Overall, the available oral toxicokinetic data indicate an oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride of higher than 10% in both rats and dogs. Therefore, an oral absorption of 50% is used in the safety assessment for the calculation of the margin of safety (MoS)." ;

During Meetings of the Commission Working Group on the Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Substances it has been stated several times that human skin absorption is less than 0.3%, but may be higher in damaged skin. In the SCCNFP Opinion concerning boric acid, borates and tetraborates adopted 23 September 1998 (SCCNFP/0024/98) the percutaneous absorption was considered to be about 0.2%. The SCCS considers that the available measurements of dermal absorption have a significant degree of uncertainty. Therefore an absorption of 0.5% will be used in the safety evaluation for the boric compounds discussed in this Opinion (representing the absorption of boric acid + 2 x SD [0.23 + 2 x 0.13%] from the study of Wester et al., 1998). This is in agreement with other recent risk assessment of borates in EU (EU, 2009a, ECHA, 2010). It should be noted that skin absorption is probably higher in case of damaged skin. The dermal absorption of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was slightly lower than that for the other boron compounds, however the octaborate was applied at a higher concentration, and the percentage of absorption would probably be higher if lower concentrations had been used. Absorption for oral and inhalation routes are assumed to be 100% (ECHA, 2010)" ;

                "Triclosan is rapidly absorbed as indicated by the time to reach Cmax. Two peaks (2 x Tmax) in plasma triclosan levels were detected in mice and rats, with peakplasma concentrations occurring after 1 and 4 hours in these 2 species. Cmax values obtained following 2 versus 200 mg/kg body weight/day did not reflect the 100-fold increase in dose of triclosan. A comparison of the Cmax data for the low and high doses indicates that the process of absorption may be at least partially saturated at the high dose level and elimination may be enhanced. Triclosan appeared to have high systemic exposure following oral administration, based on urinary excretion data (i.e., high levels of radioactivity were excreted in the urine following dosing, indicating good absorption). plasma concentrations at c max were comparable following the bolus radiolabelled dose on day 14 compared to the single dose in hamsters. the data indicate that triclosan is efficiently eliminated from organs/tissues of the hamster and that there is no accumulation in these tissues after repeated exposure to triclosan. metabolism: in addition to the parent compound and parent conjugates (glucuronide and sulfate), several non-parent metabolites and conjugates were detected [parent (m1), parent glucuronide (m7), parent sulfate (m4), non-parent metabolites (m2 and m3) and corresponding conjugates]. the non-parent metabolites are products of phase 1 metabolism, which are subsequently conjugated (phase 2 metabolites). following repeated dosing at target dose levels of 200 mg/kg body weight/day, there were more than 7-fold and 2-fold decreases in the levels of the non-parent metabolites in the urine of male mice (52.5 to 7.3%) [van dijk, 1995 (81)] and hamsters (38.5 to 16.4% ) [van dijk, 1994 (80)], respectively. concomitant increases in the appearance of glucuronide conjugates in the urine were observed for both species, suggesting a decrease of phase 1 metabolism with repeated doses of triclosan.

Therefore, any continued uptake of inhaled D5, following the achievement of steady state concentrations in the major tissues, would be related to metabolism or loading into fat. However, in studies conducted to address the potential for bioaccumulation of D5, tissue concentrations, even in the fat, did not increase with repeated exposures up to 6 months duration." ;

                "The toxicokinetic behavior of D5 in humans was evaluated by the University of Rochester in following a similar protocol as for D4 (Reddy et al., 2003; Utell et al., 1998). The study was designed to investigate the effects of D5 and D4 on human lung function. The investigations were needed to help define any health consequences of exposure, to determine if exposure to low-levels of these compounds alters human lung function, to better understand the normal uptake and clearance of silicones in humans, and to help establish guidelines for acceptable levels of exposure. For the study, non-smoking health participants with normal lung function were chosen. Each subject participated in two exposures, at least one-week apart, to either D4 or D5 or air. Lung function has been assessed by breathing tests performed before and after exposure. Blood, urine and exhaled breath samples have been collected before, immediately after, as well as 6 and 24 hr after exposure and analyzed in the laboratory for silicone levels.\r\nA blood sample was collected for routine laboratory studies, including complete blood count and liver function tests. Subjects also exercised on a stationary bicycle for 10 minutes to become familiar with the equipment. On a separate day the subjects were exposed during one-hour to 10 ppm silicone (either D4 or D5) or air. The exposures have been performed using a small bag-in-box chamber breathing through a mouthpiece; the chamber facility was designed to allow continuous monitoring of the inhaled silicone levels. For two 10 minute periods near the beginning and end of the study, the subjects exercised on a stationary bicycle at a level sufficient to mildly increase their breathing. Breathing has been monitored during these exercise periods.\r\nInhaled and exhaled silicone levels have been monitored continuously during the exposure. The lung function tests have been performed before, immediately after, and 2 and 24 hours after exposure. Exhaled air, blood, and urine samples have been collected at the same time points. Small catheters have been placed in a vein in the forearm of volunteers to allow the collection of several blood samples. After at least a one-week interval, subjects have been returned for other exposures to either air or the test silicone (D4 or D5). Blood chemistries (CBC, albumin, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, creatinine, LDH, total protein, and BUN), serum acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56/16 and CD45) and functional studies of peripheral blood monocytes (PHA proliferation and NK cell cytotoxicity) were examined immediately after, 6 and 24 hours after the end of the exposure period. Subjects also completed a 12 item questionnaire using a subjective ranking of the effects of exposure on various pulmonary parameters. Exposure was well tolerated by the subjects. The questionnaire identified symptoms that were mild in nature, and there was no significant difference between the air and D5 exposure. In addition, there was no effect on any clinical chemistry parameters, acute phase reactants, lymphocyte subsets or functional studies of blood monocytes after D5 exposure." ;

Given its physicochemical properties, BMHCA is likely to have high bioavailability via the oral route. After oral and dermal administration to experimental animals and humans (cf. section 3.3.4.2.), there is clear evidence of systemic absorption of BMHCA. However, in humans compared to rats, only limited percutaneous absorption of BMHCA (in EtOH) could be observed in vivo (1.4% vs. 19%). Species-specific differences in the metabolism of BMHCA have been identified both in vitro and in vivo. Lysmerylic acid was the main hepatic metabolite in all species tested. Quantitative evaluation of metabolic profiles for different species in an in vitro metabolism study demonstrated much higher levels of TBBA formation by rat hepatocytes when compared to other species. In particular, TBBA levels observed in human hepatocytes were about 4-fold lower compared to rat hepatocytes at corresponding concentrations. Comparative assessment of the urinary metabolites in different animal species again uncovered differences in the urinary excretion of TBBA (and TBHA), with rats being the species that predominantly forms TBBA. However, the differences observed between rats and monkeys did not mirror the 4-fold difference in TBBA formation as seen with rat and human liver microsomes in vitro." ;

Additional studies were conducted to determine blood and urine levels of triclosan (as a measure of absorption) following single and multiple percutaneous applications of triclosan in different vehicles including soaps, creams, other skin cleansers and surgical scrubs. Together, these data support findings indicating that percutaneous triclosan absorption is minimal [Caudal et al., 1974 (125); Thompson et al., 1975a (127); Hong et al., 1976 (24)]. " ;

During Meetings of the Commission Working Group on the Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Substances it has been stated several times that human skin absorption is less than 0.3%, but may be higher in damaged skin. In the SCCNFP Opinion concerning boric acid, borates and tetraborates adopted 23 September 1998 (SCCNFP/0024/98) the percutaneous absorption was considered to be about 0.2%. The SCCS considers that the available measurements of dermal absorption have a significant degree of uncertainty. Therefore an absorption of 0.5% will be used in the safety evaluation for the boric compounds discussed in this Opinion (representing the absorption of boric acid + 2 x SD [0.23 + 2 x 0.13%] from the study of Wester et al., 1998). This is in agreement with other recent risk assessment of borates in EU (EU, 2009a, ECHA, 2010). It should be noted that skin absorption is probably higher in case of damaged skin. The dermal absorption of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was slightly lower than that for the other boron compounds, however the octaborate was applied at a higher concentration, and the percentage of absorption would probably be higher if lower concentrations had been used. Absorption for oral and inhalation routes are assumed to be 100% (ECHA, 2010)" ;

WHO (2010) provides guidance on the characterization and application of PBPK models in risk assessment.

Model structure, code and parameters have appropriate biological bases and do not violate any modeling principles or known boundary conditions of biological processes: High SCCS agree; How well does the PBPK model reproduce the chemical-specific PK data under various experimental or exposure conditions?: This model consistently reproduces the general trend of the following data using a single set of species and chemical specific parameters for all the data: • multiple dose levels • oral, dermal and inhalation routes of exposures • rodents and humans. The model reproduces the most plausible dose metric associated with hazard endpoints used in the SCCS RA (parent D5 AUC in blood) separate from total material (parent + metabolites): High SCCS agree; How reliable is the PBPK model with regard to its predictions of dose metrics relevant to risk assessment? :The model reliably reproduces the most plausible dose metric associated with hazard endpoints used in the SCCS RA (parent D5 AUC in blood) separate from total material (parent + metabolites) in both rats and humans at relevant dose levels (within the range of known pharmacokinetic linearity) and relevant exposure routes for consumers (inhalation and dermal): High SCCS agree. SCCS re-estimated the Cmax and AUC with the human D5 PBPK model following inhalation exposure of humans to 10 ppm and then compared with the AUC and Cmax calculated .Concentration  ppm:  Dose metric Cmax (mg/l)  Observed* Predicted** : AUC (mg x h /l)  Observed* Predicted**;  10 :  0.052*  0.056**: 0.34* 0.17** (*values calculated from the Table 1-2 for human with Phoenix software, ** predicted with the PBPK model provided by the applicant (code for D5 and human) following 1h inhalation exposure. The sensitivity analysis has been well assessed according the WHO guidance: because parameter could be sensitive at different times, sensitivity analysis was performed and values were calculated at different times for a single exposure simulation. The human data were used for calibration of the human PBPK model; under these considerations, additional model evaluation aspects are needed regarding the reliability (model testing, uncertainty and sensitivity) as described and recommended by WHO 2012 in figure 10. This evaluation allow that when a human PBPK model is not evaluated with empirical data, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are conducted to determine the reliability of PBPK model prediction. Conclusion for human PBPK model: The model does reproduce the peak concentration (Cmax) and the AUC described in the McMullin study. Even if there are discrepancies between the predictions and the observed experimental data in AUC, the ratio (Ratio predicted/observed) is less than 2, which is acceptable according the WHO guidance. Therefore, the SCCS considers that the model is suitable for risk assessment." ;

                "PBPK models: To understand the influence of kinetic factors on delivered dose of these siloxanes, a comprehensive set of kinetic studies were conducted over the last several years. In association with development of these kinetic data, seven PBPK models have been published describing the biological and physicochemical processes regulating the kinetic disposition of either D4 or D5 in various species after different routes of exposure (Andersen et al., 2001; Reddy et al., 2003; Sarangapani et al., 2003; ENVIRON 2005; Reddy et al., 2007; Reddy et al., 2008; Tobin et al., 2008). The individual models were each developed with specific datasets to describe the kinetic behavior of either D4 or D5 in either rats or humans following various routes of administration. Table 5 (taken from Yang et al., 2012): Summary of existing rodent and human PBPK models for D4 and D5 The first modeling work by Andersen et al. (2001) uncovered a variety of unique processes that regulate siloxane kinetics in the rodent following inhalation compared to other volatile organic compounds. Among those characteristics were low blood:air partitioning, high fat:blood partitioning, high metabolic clearance by the liver, and slower loss of D4 from tissues than expected for simple well-mixed, flow-limited uptake compartments. In addition, a discrepancy between the rate of D4 elimination via exhalation and the associated blood levels following inhalation exposure indicated the presence of a pool of D4 in the plasma that was not available for exhalation. These observations led to inclusion of several ‘deep- tissue compartments’ to account for slow, multi-phasic loss after cessation of exposure, a pool (compartment) in blood assumed to represent lipoproteins, called a mobile lipid pool (MLP), and multiple fat compartments to describe the longer-time exhalation curves indicative of slower release of D4 from fat compartments. D5 has greater lipophilicity and lower blood:air partitioning than D4. The process of fitting a PBPK model to the rat inhalation studies with D5 required addition of other deep tissue compartments and deep tissue stores within the blood compartment. Thus, the rat D5 inhalation description (Reddy et al., 2008) has the largest number of tissue compartments of all the siloxane PBPK models. The dermal studies and the human volunteer studies do not have sufficient resolution to require expansion of the number of compartments. The dermal studies provide information to characterize the dynamics of uptake at the skin surface (Reddy et al., 2007) and the human inhalation studies, especially with D4, provided time- course information for metabolites that was not available from the rat studies (Reddy et al., 2003). The published human models for D4 (Reddy et al., 2003, 2007) and D5 (Reddy et al., 2007, 2008) simulated the time-course biomarker data of D4 and D5 collected during inhalation or dermal exposure. Compared to the rat models, human models had a simpler structure due to the more limited data sets that can be obtained from human volunteers. Due to these differences, the compartmental structures included in the models varied according to available data sets and the goals of model development. As more data became available, the model structures have been modified and updated. This variety of models, however, presents challenges when wanting to use these models for human health risk assessments because it is difficult to determine which models structures to use to compare internal dose metrics across compounds and species. To improve the utility of these models for risk assessment, a single multi-route and multi-species siloxane PBPK model was built in which the key chemical-specific biological and kinetic features determined in previous PBPK models were preserved (Yang et al., 2012 - ref 84). The harmonized rat model structure describes the extensive set of kinetic data on the time– course concentrations of total radiolabeled D4 and D5 in exhaled breath, blood, several tissues and urine during and following a both single and multiple exposure levels at several concentrations in rats using a consistent set of chemical and species specific parameters. To ensure consistency between the updated multi-purpose model and the original D4 and D5 models, the model estimated time-averaged plasma and liver concentrations in the rat following 160 ppm D5 and 700 ppm D4, possible dose metrics for risk assessment, were compared with the values obtained in the original PBPK models and determined to be consistent. Once a harmonized model structure was developed using inhalation studies in the rats and human volunteers for siloxanes, the inhalation model was expanded to accommodate dermal absorption where the biochemical and metabolism parameters were consistent between the exposure routes. A skin application model was added and used to simulate input of D5 from dermal exposure. Once the chemicals enter the systemic circulation, they were assumed to follow the same kinetics as the chemicals absorbed from inhalation. The harmonized model consists of six tissue compartments including blood, lung, liver, slowly perfused tissues, and rapidly perfused tissues (Figure 2). Figure 2: Diagram of the multi-purpose D4/D5 PBPK model structure that describes (a) the time –course tissue concentrations of D4 and D5 (b) hydroxylated D5 metabolite sub-model (c) short chain silanol metabolite sub-model (d) production and distribution of the mobile lipid pool (e) dermal uptake of D4 and D5 in humans. Cyclic volatiles methylsiloxanes (VMSs) are extensively cleared from the body via exhalation of free parent material and hepatic metabolism to various polar silanol metabolites. As discovered in previous modeling efforts, the measured plasma concentrations of parent siloxane represent both a bound, sequestered pool of siloxane and a free, circulating portion of the siloxane that is available for distribution to other tissues and exhalation from the lung. In the model, this unavailable pool of material is described as a portion of parent siloxane bound to lipids such as blood lipoproteins, a hypothesis that still needs to be experimentally determined. The current model describes hepatic metabolism as a dose-dependent, saturable process and simulates the time-course concentrations of both parent siloxane and total silanol metabolites separate from total radiolabeled equivalents. For D5, circulating blood and tissue concentrations of the hydroxylated D5 metabolite are also described. For the parameterization of the harmonized D4/D5 Rat inhalation model, the datasets used for D5 are the tissue time-course data for total radioactivity and parent chemical from 14C- D5 inhalation studies in male and female rats that were collected following a single (either at 7 or 160 ppm) inhalation exposure for 6 hr/day or multiple exposure at 160 ppm (see above Tobin et al., 2008). The time series data included exhaled breath, tissues of blood, liver, fat, and lung, urine, and feces. For the human data, the datasets were issued from the study on 3 male and 2 females subjects exposed to D5 vapor at 10 ppm for 1 hour. During the exposure, subjects performed intermittent exercise alternating rest and exercise periods on regular interval. The corresponding changes in the ventilation rate and the minute volume were recorded. Blood and exhaled breath samples were collected during the exposure and the post- exposure period up to 24h after the cessation of the exposure. The dermal exposure route was then added to the model following parameterization of the inhalation model. The Reddy et al. (2007) model and associated data sets were used to describe the skin compartment and simulate the dermal uptake data from human volunteers." ;
        ont:metabolism            "Metabolism of D5 (and D4) occurs in the liver by methyl-group-oxidation, rearrangement of the subsequent Si-CH2OH to SiOCH3 followed by hydrolysis with ring opening to produce a series of linear silanols that are excreted in urine. Unlike D4, D5 is metabolized to a stable, lipophilic cyclic metabolite, possibly hydroxyl-D5 (ref 81). Two major metabolites and five minor metabolites have been identified in the urine of female rats administered 14C-D5 orally. The hepatic metabolism of D5 was linear at the exposure levels evaluated in the kinetic rodent studies. Fig. 1: Possible pathways for the formation of the metabolites of D5 in Fischer 344 rat urine (from Varaprath et al., 2003) While D5 is very lipophilic, the studies show that it has a high rate of clearance, both by metabolism and exhalation. Comparison of blood and tissue concentrations after 14 days of exposure (ref 71) indicates a lack of bioaccumulation of this compound in the rat." ;

These data show that triclosan is metabolised in the skin. the percutaneous absorption studies were conducted in the rat. the results of these studies show that the extent of percutaneous absorption of triclosan is dependent on the vehicle used for application. the extent of triclosan absorption was in the range of 23 to 28% of the applied dose either in ethanol, ethanol/water, soap suspension, or a cream formulation. greater absorption was observed with triclosan in an aqueous solution or in vaseline, while lower absorption was observed with triclosan in shampoo. in addition to the absorption data from these four studies, plasma data from rats that received 14 days of repeated dermal applications of triclosan in acetone showed dose-dependent increases in plasma triclosan levels starting at the lowest dose used in the study (0.3 mg/rat/day, or 1.2 mg/kg bw/day in a 250 g rat, giving plasma levels of 1.0 µg/mL) [burns, 1997b (10)]. taken together, these data indicate that triclosan is readily absorbed through the skin of rats. vehicle : time point (hours) : % dose absorbed : reference;  pure ethanol :48 :28: black and howes, 1975 (23); shampoo : 48: 3 to 4: black and howes, 1975 (23); aerosol deodorant1 : 48: 52 : black and howes, 1975 (23); solution (ethanol, acetone) : 96 : 93 : ciba-geigy, 1976b (25); cream : 48 : 23 : ciba-geigy, 1976b (25); vaseline : 144 : 73 : ciba-geigy, 1976b (25); ethanol/water (9:1) : 24 : 21 : moss et al., 2000 (21);  soap suspension : 72 : 28 : hong et al., 1976 (24). 1*the determination of absorption following aerosol application was reported to be difficult by the authors of this study due to the lack of a standardized application of the spray. as such, the value of 52% should be interpreted cautiously.

In these studies, although the specific conjugates were not differentiated (i.e., glucuronic acid and sulphuric acid conjugates), results showed that the majority of circulating triclosan was in the conjugated form. In a small study, 6 subjects used triclosan-containing soap for 45 days, with plasma steady-state concentrations ranging from 100 to 2,580 ng/mL. Plasma from subjects with lower steadystate levels contained primarily glucuronide conjugates, whereas plasma from subjects with higher steady-state levels contained primarily sulphate conjugates [Wagner and Leshar, 1977 (139)]. The predominant route of excretion following percutaneous application of triclosan is the\r\nurine (2 to 14% of the applied dose) [Stierlin, 1972b (121); Caudal et al., 1974 (125); Thompson et al., 1975b (128)], with much smaller amounts appearing in the faeces (0.5 to 2% of the applied dose) [Stierlin, 1972b (121)].

Absorbed silver is distributed widely throughout the body. Data on the extent of oral absorption is variable but is generally accepted to be relatively low. Juberg (1997) reports oral absorption values for silver in animal studies of less than 10%; WHO (2003) states that up to 5% of colloidal silver can be absorbed after oral exposure. Important factors in the absorption of silver include the presence and extent of silver-binding proteins and the solubility of the silver species (Juberg 1997). Lansdown (2010) states that passive gastrointestinal absorption of the free silver ion is unlikely to be significant due to its reactivity with sulphydryl, carboxyl, hydroxy and protein ligands on mucosal surfaces and cell debris. Silver readily reacts with organic constituents of food, which further limits its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The extent of oral absorption is therefore variable but is estimated not to exceed 5- 10% and is thought likely to be influenced by factors such as the presence of food and gastrointestinal transit time (ATSDR, 1990)." ;

        ont:distribution    "The systemic distribution of orally absorbed silver is limited by extensive biliary excretion (first-pass effect) (Juberg, 1997). Absorbed silver is extensively bound to serum proteins including albumin and ceruloplasmin. Soluble silver ions may be deposited in tissues as insoluble salts such the silver chloride or silver phosphate (ATSDR, 1990); these insoluble salts are subsequently transformed to silver selenide and silver sulphide. Dermal silver deposits in one case of argyria were identified as being primarily composed of silver sulphide (Buckley et al, 1965). The characteristic blue or grey discoloration of skin exposed to sunlight in humans with argyria may be caused by the photoreduction of deposited insoluble silver salts to metallic silver (ATSDR, 1990). Studies in the rat have also characterised silver deposits in internal organs as the silver sulphide (Berry & Galle 1982). While deposition of silver has been observed in many organs and tissues, the liver and skin are identified as the main storage centres for silver in the body (ATSDR, 1990; Faust, 1992). Exposed experimental animals and humans show granular deposits containing silver in both pigmented and non-pigmented skin. In studies using injection of radiolabelled metallic silver and silver nitrate in the rat, the highest concentrations of silver were identified in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, blood, kidney, muscle, bone and then skin. The proportion of silver distributed to the tissues is positively correlated with the dose administered (ATSDR, 1990). Lansdown (2010) states that there is no convincing evidence for the passage of silver across the blood-brain-barrier or blood-CSF-barrier." ;
        ont:excretion       "Excretion of silver in experimental animals is mainly via the bile, with little urinary excretion (Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003). Biliary excretion is also the major route in humans, with urinary excretion of minor importance (Lansdown, 2010). Silver binds to and induces the expression of metallothioneins in the liver, thereby facilitating its biliary excretion. Cumulative excretion of silver in experimental animals (mice, rats, monkeys and dogs) ranged from 90-99%, with retention of up to 10%. Similar retention is observed in humans. Half-lives of approximately 50 days are reported for silver (Faust, 992; Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003). Whole-body retention studies in mice and monkeys following oral dosing with radiolabelled silver nitrate indicate that silver excretion in these species follows a biexponential profile with biological half-lives of 0.1 and 1.6 days in mice and 0.3 and 3 days in monkeys. In similarly exposed rats and dogs, silver excretion followed a triexponential profile with biological half-lives of 0.1, 0.7, and 5.9 days in rats and 0.1, 7.6, and 33.8 days in dogs (Furchner et al, 1968). Saturation of the elimination pathway in the liver occurring with chronic or high level acute exposure leads to excretion in the faeces decreasing and deposition in tissues increasing. Faust (1992) and ATSDR (1990) reported a study in dogs using intratracheal administration of metallic silver, the lung clearance of the metallic silver was accompanied by increased silver in the stomach and liver due to the mucociliary escalator and consequent ingestion. Dissolution of the silver into the blood was the main route of clearance from the lungs. Within 30 days, approximately 90% of the dose was excreted in the faeces." ;

The SCCS agrees with the conclusion of the sccp and therefore, the submitted toxicokinetic studies have not been evaluated by the sccs in this opinion. Overall SCCS conclusion on oral absorption based on the toxicokinetic studies: As the toxicokinetic studies could not be evaluated by the SCCS (see the SCCS comments above), the oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride from mouthwashes, cosmetic products containing up to 0.1% cetylpyridinium chloride or from all other oral hygiene cosmetic products containing up to 0.5% (w/w) cetylpyridinium chloride cannot be estimated. According to the notes of guidance, 50% oral absorption is used in case inadequate data on oral absorption are available. However, if there is evidence to suggest poor oral bioavailability, it may be more appropriate to assume that only 10% of the administered dose is systemically available. From the submitted oral toxicokinetic study in rats, the oral absorption was estimated to be approximately 14% following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage. However, in another study with intravenous injection of 2.5 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose to rats, the major part of applied radioactivity was excreted in urine and faeces in similar amounts. The latter study indicates that biliary excretion of cetylpyridinium chloride takes place in rats and therefore, the estimate of 14% absorption following oral administration based on faecal excretion in the oral rat study is not supported by the intravenous rat study. In one of the submitted oral toxicokinetic studies in dogs, 10-15% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage, whereas in the other submitted oral toxicokinetic studies in dogs, 22% of the radioactivity was reported to be excreted in the urine, also following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage. however, the low recovery of the radioactivity in these studies is a major drawback for the interpretation of the results in both studies. Overall, the available oral toxicokinetic data indicate an oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride of higher than 10% in both rats and dogs. Therefore, an oral absorption of 50% is used in the safety assessment for the calculation of the margin of safety (MoS)." ;

During Meetings of the Commission Working Group on the Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Substances it has been stated several times that human skin absorption is less than 0.3%, but may be higher in damaged skin. In the SCCNFP Opinion concerning boric acid, borates and tetraborates adopted 23 September 1998 (SCCNFP/0024/98) the percutaneous absorption was considered to be about 0.2%. The SCCS considers that the available measurements of dermal absorption have a significant degree of uncertainty. Therefore an absorption of 0.5% will be used in the safety evaluation for the boric compounds discussed in this Opinion (representing the absorption of boric acid + 2 x SD [0.23 + 2 x 0.13%] from the study of Wester et al., 1998). This is in agreement with other recent risk assessment of borates in EU (EU, 2009a, ECHA, 2010). It should be noted that skin absorption is probably higher in case of damaged skin. The dermal absorption of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was slightly lower than that for the other boron compounds, however the octaborate was applied at a higher concentration, and the percentage of absorption would probably be higher if lower concentrations had been used. Absorption for oral and inhalation routes are assumed to be 100% (ECHA, 2010)" ;

                "Triclosan is rapidly absorbed as indicated by the time to reach Cmax. Two peaks (2 x Tmax) in plasma triclosan levels were detected in mice and rats, with peakplasma concentrations occurring after 1 and 4 hours in these 2 species. Cmax values obtained following 2 versus 200 mg/kg body weight/day did not reflect the 100-fold increase in dose of triclosan. A comparison of the Cmax data for the low and high doses indicates that the process of absorption may be at least partially saturated at the high dose level and elimination may be enhanced. Triclosan appeared to have high systemic exposure following oral administration, based on urinary excretion data (i.e., high levels of radioactivity were excreted in the urine following dosing, indicating good absorption). plasma concentrations at c max were comparable following the bolus radiolabelled dose on day 14 compared to the single dose in rats. in contrast, the c max level for a single oral dose of triclosan in plasma following repeated daily exposure was decreased in mice, compared to plasma levels following a single dose. it should be noted that tissue distribution data in the murine pk/adme study showed that, at the oral dose of 200 mg/kg body weight/day for 14 days, levels of triclosan in the liver of male mice were approximately 2 times higher than levels in plasma. metabolism: in addition to the parent compound and parent conjugates (glucuronide and sulfate), several non-parent metabolites and conjugates were detected [parent (m1), parent glucuronide (m7), parent sulfate (m4), non-parent metabolites (m2 and m3) and corresponding conjugates]. the non-parent metabolites are products of phase 1 metabolism, which are subsequently conjugated (phase 2 metabolites). following repeated dosing at target dose levels of 200 mg/kg body weight/day, there were more than 7-fold and 2-fold decreases in the levels of the non-parent metabolites in the urine of male mice (52.5 to 7.3%) [van dijk, 1995 (81)] and hamsters (38.5 to 16.4% ) [van dijk, 1994 (80)], respectively. concomitant increases in the appearance of glucuronide conjugates in the urine were observed for both species, suggesting a decrease of phase 1 metabolism with repeated doses of triclosan. Based on whole-body autoradiography studies that identified high levels of radioactivity in the gall bladder and GI tract, and data showing the presence of 2 peak concentrations in the plasma following single or repeated dosing, it has been suggested that mice and rats exhibit enterohepatic circulation" ;

Infant exposure to triclosan from breast milk has been shown to be significantly lower than exposure to the mother, based on a comparison of triclosan concentrations in breast milk and plasma [Allmyr et al., 2006 (103)]. No measured exposure data for babies and young children following use of consumer products containing triclosan was identified in the literature, except spot urine measurements in the age group 6-11 years from the NHANES study [Calafat et al. 2008; AR3]. Based on the conversion of spot urine concentrations to estimated dose, this subpopulation had a lower aggregate exposure to triclosan than children of 11-19 years and adults [US EPA 2008 (AR9)]. The rapid increase in maturation of glucuronidation ability within the first year and the maturity of the sulfation pathway, indicate that capabilities of children to metabolise triclosan through glucuronidation or sulfation are likely comparable to those of adults. Also, glomerular filtration rates normalised to body weight approach adult values by around 6 months of age and renal tubular function matures to near-adult values by around 1 year of age (Alcorn and McNamara, 2002). Accordingly, studies have shown that elimination is comparable in adults and children." ;

During Meetings of the Commission Working Group on the Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Substances it has been stated several times that human skin absorption is less than 0.3%, but may be higher in damaged skin. In the SCCNFP Opinion concerning boric acid, borates and tetraborates adopted 23 September 1998 (SCCNFP/0024/98) the percutaneous absorption was considered to be about 0.2%. The SCCS considers that the available measurements of dermal absorption have a significant degree of uncertainty. Therefore an absorption of 0.5% will be used in the safety evaluation for the boric compounds discussed in this Opinion (representing the absorption of boric acid + 2 x SD [0.23 + 2 x 0.13%] from the study of Wester et al., 1998). This is in agreement with other recent risk assessment of borates in EU (EU, 2009a, ECHA, 2010). It should be noted that skin absorption is probably higher in case of damaged skin. The dermal absorption of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was slightly lower than that for the other boron compounds, however the octaborate was applied at a higher concentration, and the percentage of absorption would probably be higher if lower concentrations had been used. Absorption for oral and inhalation routes are assumed to be 100% (ECHA, 2010)" ;

                "Retention of radioactivity following single and repeated exposures was relatively low (up to 2% of inhaled D5 if fur deposition is excluded – see below). Radioactivity and parent D5 was widely distributed to tissues of both male and female rats, with the maximum concentration of radioactivity observed in most tissues by 3-h post exposure. Fat was a depot for D5, with elimination occurring much slower than observed for plasma and other tissues. In all groups, the primary route for elimination of radioactivity was through expired air. Analyses for parent D5 indicated that essentially all the radioactivity in the expired volatiles was unchanged D5. Repeated exposure gave rise to higher levels of parent D5 in the lung and fat of both sexes and in female liver relative to the single exposure. Immediately after sacrifice approximately 50% of the radioactivity was parent. Five polar metabolites of D5 were identified in urine, with no parent D5 detected. The urine had polar silanols. Radiochromatograms had two peaks in feces. One corresponded to the retention time for D5. The second has been tentatively identified as hydroxylated D5. In contrast to D4, the PBPK modeling for D5 requires description of a stable metabolite, called HO-D5, and a polar metabolite pool that is rapidly eliminated to urine. The concentration of stable metabolite in liver, lung and plasma was too low for unequivocal chemical determination. The amount of metabolites in the plasma, liver, lungs and fat was estimated by subtracting the concentration of chemical determined using GC/MS from the concentration determined using radiochemical detection. Despite the nose-only exposure design, a significant amount of D5 was deposited on the fur of the animals following either single or multiple exposures to D5. This, in combination with the distribution to the gastrointestinal tract suggesting ingestion of the compound, led to an additional experiment (Ref. 70). Groups of 4 to 5 male and female animals were exposed to air (nose only) containing 160 ppm 14C-D5 for 6 hours. Immediately following exposure, one group of males and one group of females, were euthanized while still loaded in the exposure chamber, then transferred to metabolism cages for 6 hours, and used to determine levels of 14C-D5 off-gassed from the pelt. The total body burden of both radioactivity and parent chemical from these animals was compared with the results from two additional groups of males and females that were not sacrificed and moved immediately following the exposure period into individual Roth style glass metabolism cages. Urine, faeces and expired air were collected from each live animal at various time points up to 168-hours post-exposure. As close as possible to the 168-hour post-exposure time point, animals were euthanized, tissues collected, and the remaining carcasses were solubilized. In the animals that were euthanized before removal from the exposure chambers, significant amounts of D5 were measured in the cages and the volatile traps for both males and females, indicating volatilization of D5 from the animal’s fur. However, the deposition rate of D5 collected in the expired air via volatile traps was greater for the euthanized than for the live rats. It was noted that after the rats were moved to metabolism cages, routine grooming could result in ingestion of D5 from the fur, reducing the amount of D5 available for evaporation from the fur of the live animals that could contribute to continued post- exposure inhalation of D5. This ingestion of D5 during grooming is also supported by the amounts of radioactivity measured in the gastrointestinal tract of the animals exposed to 14C-D5 via inhalation. The mass balance, as a percentage of total recovered amounts, in the live animals measured in this experiment was different than noted in the initial single exposure study (ref. 69) with a higher fraction of the recovered radioactivity in the expired air. This could be attributed to the immediate transfer of the animals to metabolism cages increasing the capture of expired volatiles from exhalation and volatilization from the pelt." ;

Percutaneous absorption of triclosan from the use of triclosan-containing soap, underarm product and talc was also shown to be detectable in subjects already using triclosan-containing toothpaste [BIBRA International, 1988 (137); Beiswanger and Tuohy, 1990 (138)]. Two studies comparing oral exposure to triclosan-containing toothpaste alone and in combination with percutaneously applied triclosan-containing products (e.g., soap, talc, anti-perspirant/underarm deodorant) revealed that, in each study and for both groups, circulating metabolites were composed primarily of glucuronide for the duration of the study (8 and 13 weeks) [BIBRA International, 1988 (137); Beiswanger and Tuohy, 1990 (138)]. Plasma concentrations of total triclosan generally did not exceed 100 ng/mL in the 8-week study and ranged from approximately 20 to 30 ng/mL in the 13-week study. In the 13-week study [Beiswanger and Tuohy, 1990 (138)], the group receiving oral plus percutaneous exposure had increased blood levels of total triclosan and glucuronide-conjugated triclosan (approximately 24 to 30 and 26 to 29 ng/mL, respectively) compared with the group receiving oral exposure only (approximately 19 to 22 and 19 to 21 ng/mL, respectively) throughout the study (Weeks 3, 6, and 13). In summary, the relative ratio of glucuronide to sulphate conjugates alters with repeat dosing (i.e., as plasma steady-state triclosan levels are reached) versus single dosing. Generally, lower plasma concentrations of total triclosan are associated with glucuronide conjugates as the predominant metabolite. With increasing plasma levels of total triclosan, there is an increase in circulating sulphate conjugates, which can reach levels greater than those attained by glucuronide conjugates, given high enough plasma levels of total triclosan." ;

The SCCS agrees with the conclusion of the sccp and therefore, the submitted toxicokinetic studies have not been evaluated by the sccs in this opinion. Overall SCCS conclusion on oral absorption based on the toxicokinetic studies: As the toxicokinetic studies could not be evaluated by the SCCS (see the SCCS comments above), the oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride from mouthwashes, cosmetic products containing up to 0.1% cetylpyridinium chloride or from all other oral hygiene cosmetic products containing up to 0.5% (w/w) cetylpyridinium chloride cannot be estimated. According to the notes of guidance, 50% oral absorption is used in case inadequate data on oral absorption are available. However, if there is evidence to suggest poor oral bioavailability, it may be more appropriate to assume that only 10% of the administered dose is systemically available. From the submitted oral toxicokinetic study in rats, the oral absorption was estimated to be approximately 14% following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage. However, in another study with intravenous injection of 2.5 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose to rats, the major part of applied radioactivity was excreted in urine and faeces in similar amounts. The latter study indicates that biliary excretion of cetylpyridinium chloride takes place in rats and therefore, the estimate of 14% absorption following oral administration based on faecal excretion in the oral rat study is not supported by the intravenous rat study. In one of the submitted oral toxicokinetic studies in dogs, 10-15% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage, whereas in the other submitted oral toxicokinetic studies in dogs, 22% of the radioactivity was reported to be excreted in the urine, also following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage. however, the low recovery of the radioactivity in these studies is a major drawback for the interpretation of the results in both studies. Overall, the available oral toxicokinetic data indicate an oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride of higher than 10% in both rats and dogs. Therefore, an oral absorption of 50% is used in the safety assessment for the calculation of the margin of safety (MoS)." ;

Given its physicochemical properties, BMHCA is likely to have high bioavailability via the oral route. After oral and dermal administration to experimental animals and humans (cf. section 3.3.4.2.), there is clear evidence of systemic absorption of BMHCA. However, in humans compared to rats, only limited percutaneous absorption of BMHCA (in EtOH) could be observed in vivo (1.4% vs. 19%). Species-specific differences in the metabolism of BMHCA have been identified both in vitro and in vivo. Lysmerylic acid was the main hepatic metabolite in all species tested. Quantitative evaluation of metabolic profiles for different species in an in vitro metabolism study demonstrated much higher levels of TBBA formation by rat hepatocytes when compared to other species. In particular, TBBA levels observed in human hepatocytes were about 4-fold lower compared to rat hepatocytes at corresponding concentrations. Comparative assessment of the urinary metabolites in different animal species again uncovered differences in the urinary excretion of TBBA (and TBHA), with rats being the species that predominantly forms TBBA. However, the differences observed between rats and monkeys did not mirror the 4-fold difference in TBBA formation as seen with rat and human liver microsomes in vitro." ;

During Meetings of the Commission Working Group on the Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Substances it has been stated several times that human skin absorption is less than 0.3%, but may be higher in damaged skin. In the SCCNFP Opinion concerning boric acid, borates and tetraborates adopted 23 September 1998 (SCCNFP/0024/98) the percutaneous absorption was considered to be about 0.2%. The SCCS considers that the available measurements of dermal absorption have a significant degree of uncertainty. Therefore an absorption of 0.5% will be used in the safety evaluation for the boric compounds discussed in this Opinion (representing the absorption of boric acid + 2 x SD [0.23 + 2 x 0.13%] from the study of Wester et al., 1998). This is in agreement with other recent risk assessment of borates in EU (EU, 2009a, ECHA, 2010). It should be noted that skin absorption is probably higher in case of damaged skin. The dermal absorption of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was slightly lower than that for the other boron compounds, however the octaborate was applied at a higher concentration, and the percentage of absorption would probably be higher if lower concentrations had been used. Absorption for oral and inhalation routes are assumed to be 100% (ECHA, 2010)" ;

        ont:SCCS_comment_to_test        "The in vivo percutaneous absorption of triclosan following single applications of triclosancontaining products (e.g., cream and soap) has been consistently reported as only a small proportion of the applied dose (i.e., generally ≤9%) [Stierlin, 1972b (121); Maibach, 1969 (123); Caudal et al., 1974 (125); Schenkel and Furia, 1965 (126); Thompson et al., 1975a (127)]. Additional studies were conducted to determine blood and urine levels of triclosan (as a measure of absorption) following single and multiple percutaneous applications of triclosan in different vehicles including soaps, creams, other skin cleansers and surgical scrubs. Together, these data support findings indicating that percutaneous triclosan absorption is minimal [Caudal et al., 1974 (125); Thompson et al., 1975a (127); Hong et al., 1976 (24)]. In general, blood levels of triclosan increased immediately after percutaneous application [Ciba-Geigy, 1972a (119); Ciba-Geigy, 1972b (124)], were enhanced by the presence of an occlusive dressing [Thompson et al., 1975b (128)], and were proportional to the dose applied [Ciba-Geigy, 1973b (120)]. Percutaneous absorption of triclosan from the use of BK85triclosan-containing soap, underarm product and talc was also shown to be detectable in subjects already using triclosan-containing toothpaste [BIBRA International, 1988 (137); Beiswanger and Tuohy, 1990 (138)]. In vivo percutaneous absorption studies have measured plasma concentrations of free plus conjugated triclosan as well as free triclosan following single and multiple applications of triclosan-containing products (e.g., soap, anti-perspirant, skin cleanser, hand scrub) [Thompson et al., 1975a (127); Thompson, 1975c (122); Thompson et al., 1976 (129); Hong et al., 1976 (24)]. In these studies, although the specific conjugates were not differentiated (i.e., glucuronic acid and sulphuric acid conjugates), results showed that the majority of circulating triclosan was in the conjugated form. In a small study, 6 subjects used triclosan-containing soap for 45 days, with plasma steady-state concentrations ranging from 100 to 2,580 ng/mL. Plasma from subjects with lower steadystate levels contained primarily glucuronide conjugates, whereas plasma from subjects with higher steady-state levels contained primarily sulphate conjugates [Wagner and Leshar, 1977 (139)].

The SCCS agrees with the conclusion of the sccp and therefore, the submitted toxicokinetic studies have not been evaluated by the sccs in this opinion. Overall SCCS conclusion on oral absorption based on the toxicokinetic studies: As the toxicokinetic studies could not be evaluated by the SCCS (see the SCCS comments above), the oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride from mouthwashes, cosmetic products containing up to 0.1% cetylpyridinium chloride or from all other oral hygiene cosmetic products containing up to 0.5% (w/w) cetylpyridinium chloride cannot be estimated. According to the notes of guidance, 50% oral absorption is used in case inadequate data on oral absorption are available. However, if there is evidence to suggest poor oral bioavailability, it may be more appropriate to assume that only 10% of the administered dose is systemically available. From the submitted oral toxicokinetic study in rats, the oral absorption was estimated to be approximately 14% following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage. However, in another study with intravenous injection of 2.5 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose to rats, the major part of applied radioactivity was excreted in urine and faeces in similar amounts. The latter study indicates that biliary excretion of cetylpyridinium chloride takes place in rats and therefore, the estimate of 14% absorption following oral administration based on faecal excretion in the oral rat study is not supported by the intravenous rat study. In one of the submitted oral toxicokinetic studies in dogs, 10-15% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage, whereas in the other submitted oral toxicokinetic studies in dogs, 22% of the radioactivity was reported to be excreted in the urine, also following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage. however, the low recovery of the radioactivity in these studies is a major drawback for the interpretation of the results in both studies. Overall, the available oral toxicokinetic data indicate an oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride of higher than 10% in both rats and dogs. Therefore, an oral absorption of 50% is used in the safety assessment for the calculation of the margin of safety (MoS)." ;

        ont:SCCS_comment_to_test        "No dermal absorption studies have been performed according to modern guidelines. During Meetings of the Commission Working Group on the Classification and Labelling of Dangerous Substances it has been stated several times that human skin absorption is less than 0.3%, but may be higher in damaged skin. In the SCCNFP Opinion concerning boric acid, borates and tetraborates adopted 23 September 1998 (SCCNFP/0024/98) the percutaneous absorption was considered to be about 0.2%. The SCCS considers that the available measurements of dermal absorption have a significant degree of uncertainty. Therefore an absorption of 0.5% will be used in the safety evaluation for the boric compounds discussed in this Opinion (representing the absorption of boric acid + 2 x SD [0.23 + 2 x 0.13%] from the study of Wester et al., 1998). This is in agreement with other recent risk assessment of borates in EU (EU, 2009a, ECHA, 2010). It should be noted that skin absorption is probably higher in case of damaged skin. The dermal absorption of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was slightly lower than that for the other boron compounds, however the octaborate was applied at a higher concentration, and the percentage of absorption would probably be higher if lower concentrations had been used. Absorption for oral and inhalation routes are assumed to be 100% (ECHA, 2010)" ;

Studies indicate that the relative amounts of glucuronide- and sulphate-conjugated triclosan present in the plasma vary depending on the plasma steady state concentrations of total triclosan. Up to study day 14, the main metabolite in plasma was the glucuronide conjugate (97% of total triclosan) in patients receiving 15 mg/day with only trace amounts of sulphate [Lucker et al., 1990 (109)]. Similarly, the glucuronide conjugate predominated in plasma samples from subjects brushing daily with triclosan-containing toothpaste (0.6%) [ColgatePalmolive, 1988 (136)]. However, as steady state concentrations were reached (Cmax = 330 ng/mL) during a 36-day exposure to the capsules, the absolute amount of glucuronide conjugates remained relatively constant, whereas sulphate conjugates increased to approximately 53% [Lucker et al., 1990 (109)]. In summary, the relative ratio of glucuronide to sulphate conjugates alters with repeat dosing (i.e., as plasma steady-state triclosan levels are reached) versus single dosing. Generally, lower plasma concentrations of total triclosan are associated with glucuronide conjugates as the predominant metabolite. With increasing plasma levels of total triclosan, there is an increase in circulating sulphate conjugates, which can reach levels greater than those attained by glucuronide conjugates, given high enough plasma levels of total triclosan." ;

Two peaks (2 x Tmax) in plasma triclosan levels were detected in mice and rats, with peakplasma concentrations occurring after 1 and 4 hours in these 2 species. Cmax values obtained following 2 versus 200 mg/kg body weight/day did not reflect the 100-fold increase in dose of triclosan. A comparison of the Cmax data for the low and high doses indicates that the process of absorption may be at least partially saturated at the high dose level and elimination may be enhanced. Triclosan appeared to have high systemic exposure following oral administration, based on urinary excretion data (i.e., high levels of radioactivity were excreted in the urine following dosing, indicating good absorption). in this study, the auc value calculated following an oral dose of 14c-labelled triclosan on day 14 of a repeated triclosan exposure (diet) regimen was comparable to the auc value calculated following a single oral dose. the similarity of the single dose and repeated dose auc values suggests that the amount of triclosan absorbed is equal to that eliminated. together with the similarity in plasma c max values following repeated or single doses , the data show that accumulation of triclosan is unlikely to occur with repeated exposure. Based on whole-body autoradiography studies that identified high levels of radioactivity in the gall bladder and GI tract, and data showing the presence of 2 peak concentrations in the plasma following single or repeated dosing, it has been suggested that mice and rats exhibit enterohepatic circulation" ;

The magnitude of the difference (rat:human) between average clearance values was approximately 3.6-fold and 4.9-fold for pregnant and nonpregnant individuals, respectively, in close agreement with differences in kinetic parameters predicted by allometric scaling (approximately 4-fold). The variance of boron clearance in humans was slightly greater than in rats (0.35%), but the coefficient of variation was 4-fold higher in humans than in rats. Overall, the available pharmacokinetic data support a high degree of qualitative similarity (lack of metabolism, highly cleared through renal filtration mechanisms, and apparently consistent extravascular distribution characteristics) between the relevant experimental species and humans." ;

In general, due to a pronounced first-pass effect, only trace amounts of the parent compound (i.e., unconjugated or free triclosan) are detected in the plasma. As a result of the first-pass effect, there is near total conversion of triclosan to glucuronide and sulphate conjugates [Lin, 1989 (135) and 2000 (118)]. In summary, the relative ratio of glucuronide to sulphate conjugates alters with repeat dosing (i.e., as plasma steady-state triclosan levels are reached) versus single dosing. Generally, lower plasma concentrations of total triclosan are associated with glucuronide conjugates as the predominant metabolite. With increasing plasma levels of total triclosan, there is an increase in circulating sulphate conjugates, which can reach levels greater than those attained by glucuronide conjugates, given high enough plasma levels of total triclosan." ;

        ont:SCCS_comment_to_test        "(1) Crump and Farrar (1987) calculated initial differences between treatment groups; further analysis suggests that subjects have probably not been allocated randomly to treatment groups (i.e. treatment groups differ with respect to certain variables). (2) Gardner et al. suggest that the increase of TSH secretion is rather due to increased levels of serum iodide than to the erythrosine molecule itself. However, in view of the results from toxicokinetic studies it seems to be unlikely that increased serum iodide is a consequence of erythrosine metabolism. Thus, it remains to be clarified whether and by which mechanism erythrosine might cause elevated serum iodide levels. A possible explanation has been given be Minegishi et al. (1986), see section 3.3.12- Special investigations. (3) The study had been approved by the Virginia Commonwealth University Committee on the conduct of human Research. (4) For better interpretation of the results, JECFA (1986) reports on a further study (Paul et al. (1987) which had been undertaken in order to determine whether relatively small supplementary amounts of iodine in the diet would affect thyroid function: “Normal, euthyroid human subjects received 250, 500 or 1500 µg iodine daily for 14 days; the doses were selected to correspond to the amounts of iodine that might be bioavailable from the doses of erythrosine used in the study by Gardner et al., 1987. Following administration of 1500 µg/day there were small but significant decreases in serum T4 and serum T3 concentration, a small compensatory increase in serum TSH concentrations and in the TSH response to TRH. However, all values remained within the normal range. In contrast, no changes occurred following daily administration of 250 or 500 µg I2.” From this, JECFA (1988) commented: “Additional human studies confirmed that erythrosine is poorly absorbed.

From a recalculation addressing two endpoints (basal TSH concentration and maximum TSH increment after TRH provocation), Crump and Farrar (1987) suggested that there is no statistical evidence for effects on basal TSH by erythrosine at dose levels between 60 and 200 mg/day. For maximum TSH increment after TRH stimulation, there is some evidence of an effect at the highest dose (a slight but significant increase in the top dose group). Thus, a NOAEL of 60 mg/day was derived (for a 60 kg person this would be 1.0 mg/kg bw/day) (Gardner et al., 1987; Crump and Farrar, 1987)." ;

Safety of Triclosan in Children and Neonates: The very low levels of exposure as measured in breast milk indicate that maternal use of triclosan immediately post-partum is unlikely to be a safety concern for neonates. Infant exposure to triclosan from breast milk has been shown to be significantly lower than exposure to the mother, based on a comparison of triclosan concentrations in breast milk and plasma [Allmyr et al., 2006 (103)]. No measured exposure data for babies and young children following use of consumer products containing triclosan was identified in the literature, except spot urine measurements in the age group 6-11 years from the NHANES study [Calafat et al. 2008; AR3]. Based on the conversion of spot urine concentrations to estimated dose, this subpopulation had a lower aggregate exposure to triclosan than children of 11-19 years and adults [US EPA 2008 (AR9)]. The rapid increase in maturation of glucuronidation ability within the first year and the maturity of the sulfation pathway, indicate that capabilities of children to metabolise triclosan through glucuronidation or sulfation are likely comparable to those of adults. Also, glomerular filtration rates normalised to body weight approach adult values by around 6 months of age and renal tubular function matures to near-adult values by around 1 year of age (Alcorn and McNamara, 2002). Accordingly, studies have shown that elimination is comparable in adults and children." ;

                "Information on exposure to triclosan can be derived from biomonitoring and similar studies. Urinary triclosan concentrations were assessed in a representative sample of the U.S. general population from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) by Calafat et al. (2008) [AR2]. They analyzed 2,517 urine samples by means of sensitive analytical methods and detected triclosan in about three-quarters of urine samples: The geometric mean and 95th percentile concentrations were 13.0 μg/L (12.7 μg/g creatinine) and 459.0 μg/L (363.8 μg/g creatinine), respectively. Concentrations differed by age and socioeconomic status but not by race/ethnicity and sex. Specifically, the concentrations of triclosan appeared to be highest during the third decade of life and among people with the highest household incomes. Dose estimates for triclosan based on the NHANES measurement data have not been reported by Calafat et al. since the conversion of measured spot urine concentrations to daily doses is not trivial because of several uncertainties related to variable dilution caused by wide variations in fluid intake and excretion and lack of information on route of exposure (i.e. oral, dermal, inhalation) and duration. Three methods proposed to estimate the dose from measured spot urine concentrations in the absence of total urine volume data have been recently used by the US EPA in computations for an aggregate risk assessment on triclosan (US EPA 2008; AR9)." ;
