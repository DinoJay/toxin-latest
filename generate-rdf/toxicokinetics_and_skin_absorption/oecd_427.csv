",,,the average total recovery of radioactivity in the adme groups was between 98% and 105%. ,"the average dermal absorption was very low, 2.65% or 0.005 mg/cm2. the possibility remains that the quantity retained at the skin application site could become systemically available. therefore, the dose was calculated on the absorbed fraction and the potentially systemically absorbed fraction to yield the ""total potentially absorbed fraction"". this was 3.10% of the applied dose or 0.006 mg/cm2.",concentration in the liver was also higher than in other tissues or blood,"four potential metabolite peaks of hc blue n° 15 (wr 18043) were detected in faeces extracts and urine samples. it seemed that these were the result of hydroxylation, carboxylation and/or reduction by phase I metabolic enzymes. hydroxylation was the most important. no parent compound was detected in the faeces. ","faecal excretion was the most important route of 14hc blue n° 15 (wr 18043) in all treated groups (2% after dermal dosing). this suggests that when absorbed, that biliary excretion of hc blue n° 15 (wr 18043) is important. urinary excretion was less important (0.06% after dermal application). in the dermal group the rate of urinary excretion was very slow and the amount excreted was similar over each time interval.",,,,,,,"no toxicokinetic evaluation could be performed for the dermal group, since the concentrations were below the limit of quantification.
