Studies indicate that the relative amounts of glucuronide- and sulphate-conjugated triclosan present in the plasma vary depending on the plasma steady state concentrations of total triclosan. Up to study day 14, the main metabolite in plasma was the glucuronide conjugate (97% of total triclosan) in patients receiving 15 mg/day with only trace amounts of sulphate [Lucker et al., 1990 (109)]. Similarly, the glucuronide conjugate predominated in plasma samples from subjects brushing daily with triclosan-containing toothpaste (0.6%) [ColgatePalmolive, 1988 (136)]. However, as steady state concentrations were reached (Cmax = 330 ng/mL) during a 36-day exposure to the capsules, the absolute amount of glucuronide conjugates remained relatively constant, whereas sulphate conjugates increased to approximately 53% [Lucker et al., 1990 (109)]. In summary, the relative ratio of glucuronide to sulphate conjugates alters with repeat dosing (i.e., as plasma steady-state triclosan levels are reached) versus single dosing. Generally, lower plasma concentrations of total triclosan are associated with glucuronide conjugates as the predominant metabolite. With increasing plasma levels of total triclosan, there is an increase in circulating sulphate conjugates, which can reach levels greater than those attained by glucuronide conjugates, given high enough plasma levels of total triclosan.",1990,,,109,lucker et al.,

Concentrations differed by age and socioeconomic status but not by race/ethnicity and sex. Specifically, the concentrations of triclosan appeared to be highest during the third decade of life and among people with the highest household incomes. Dose estimates for triclosan based on the NHANES measurement data have not been reported by Calafat et al. since the conversion of measured spot urine concentrations to daily doses is not trivial because of several uncertainties related to variable dilution caused by wide variations in fluid intake and excretion and lack of information on route of exposure (i.e. oral, dermal, inhalation) and duration.

The study was designed to investigate the effects of D5 and D4 on human lung function. The investigations were needed to help define any health consequences of exposure, to determine if exposure to low-levels of these compounds alters human lung function, to better understand the normal uptake and clearance of silicones in humans, and to help establish guidelines for acceptable levels of exposure. For the study, non-smoking health participants with normal lung function were chosen. Each subject participated in two exposures, at least one-week apart, to either D4 or D5 or air. Lung function has been assessed by breathing tests performed before and after exposure. Blood, urine and exhaled breath samples have been collected before, immediately after, as well as 6 and 24 hr after exposure and analyzed in the laboratory for silicone levels.
A blood sample was collected for routine laboratory studies, including complete blood count and liver function tests. Subjects also exercised on a stationary bicycle for 10 minutes to become familiar with the equipment. On a separate day the subjects were exposed during one-hour to 10 ppm silicone (either D4 or D5) or air. The exposures have been performed using a small bag-in-box chamber breathing through a mouthpiece; the chamber facility was designed to allow continuous monitoring of the inhaled silicone levels. For two 10 minute periods near the beginning and end of the study, the subjects exercised on a stationary bicycle at a level sufficient to mildly increase their breathing. Breathing has been monitored during these exercise periods.
Inhaled and exhaled silicone levels have been monitored continuously during the exposure. The lung function tests have been performed before, immediately after, and 2 and 24 hours after exposure. Exhaled air, blood, and urine samples have been collected at the same time points. Small catheters have been placed in a vein in the forearm of volunteers to allow the collection of several blood samples. After at least a one-week interval, subjects have been returned for other exposures to either air or the test silicone (D4 or D5). Blood chemistries (CBC, albumin, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, creatinine, LDH, total protein, and BUN), serum acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), lymphocyte subsets (CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56/16 and CD45) and functional studies of peripheral blood monocytes (PHA proliferation and NK cell cytotoxicity) were examined immediately after, 6 and 24 hours after the end of the exposure period. Subjects also completed a 12 item questionnaire using a subjective ranking of the effects of exposure on various pulmonary parameters. Exposure was well tolerated by the subjects. The questionnaire identified symptoms that were mild in nature, and there was no significant difference between the air and D5 exposure. In addition, there was no effect on any clinical chemistry parameters, acute phase reactants, lymphocyte subsets or functional studies of blood monocytes after D5 exposure.","Exhaled air concentrations increased rapidly to steady state and remained relatively constant during exposure. Slight changes were observed in the concentration of D5 exhaled, with increases observed during the exercising periods. For the majority of the subjects, no D5 was detected in the exhaled air by 20 minutes post-exposure. A 1-hour exposure to D5 resulted in an average total intake of 25 mg; the overall deposition fraction was 14%. Plasma concentrations of D5 increased during exposure and had returned to baseline by 24 hours post-exposure. The mean peak concentration for D5 in plasma occurred immediately post exposure (52+/- 8 ng/g) and indicated a rapid non-linear clearance from the plasma.

In summary, studies in both animals and humans indicated that only a relatively small amount of inhaled D5 was retained. Although steady state concentrations were achieved in the blood and the majority of tissues of rats, D5 concentrations in the fat tissue did not appear to achieve steady state during single or 3 hour exposures. Therefore, any continued uptake of inhaled D5, following the achievement of steady state concentrations in the major tissues, would be related to metabolism or loading into fat. However, in studies conducted to address the potential for bioaccumulation of D5, tissue concentrations, even in the fat, did not increase with repeated exposures up to 6 months duration.",,no,,68,"4/sex (control animals). Summary of in vivo human and animal toxicokinetic data:
Overall, studies in both animals and humans indicated that only 3-10% of inhaled D5 was retained following single and steady state exposures. The absorption of neat D5 was about 10% following oral exposure in rats. Only a small amount (around 0.05%) of D5 applied to human skin was absorbed into the blood and only a fraction of that was retained with the vast majority (approximately 90% of the absorbed amount) exhaled on first pass.
The kinetic behavior of D5 is similar for inhalation and dermal exposures, but dissimilar when comparing dermal and oral exposure. Following dermal exposure, most of the D5 evaporates from the skin, but for the 0.06% of the applied dose that is systemically absorbed, D5 has 1st-pass kinetics to the lungs where the majority is exhaled due to the low blood:air partition coefficient of the free D5 that is absorbed. Any retained D5 is most likely associated with a mobile lipid pool that is circulated and distributed to other organs, ultimately being metabolized by the liver. Following inhalation exposures, the majority of the inhaled D5 is exhaled due to the low blood: air partition coefficient of free D5 that is absorbed. What is not exhaled may be metabolized locally, or it is associated with a mobile lipid pool and ultimately goes to the liver where it is metabolized, demonstrating very similar behavior as the dermal kinetics. In contrast, oral dosing with D5 results in limited absorption of free D5 across the GI tract where it is metabolized by the liver and eliminated. Most of the D5 that is absorbed is absorbed along with lipids from the diet. Dietary lipid is primarily distributed to the liver where it is stored for short periods and repackaged for distribution (primarily into fat with small amounts directed to other tissues for membrane maintenance). The oral route of exposure clearly leads to 1st pass kinetics to the liver leading to metabolism or D5 that is not freely available for exhalation compared to inhalation or dermal exposures. This is distinctly different from dermal and inhalation routes of exposure.",
decamethylcyclopentasiloxane,https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_174.pdf,in vivo,non OECD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Retention of radioactivity following single and repeated exposures was relatively low (up to 2% of inhaled D5 if fur deposition is excluded – see below). Radioactivity and parent D5 was widely distributed to tissues of both male and female rats, with the maximum concentration of radioactivity observed in most tissues by 3-h post exposure. Fat was a depot for D5, with elimination occurring much slower than observed for plasma and other tissues. In all groups, the primary route for elimination of radioactivity was through expired air. Analyses for parent D5 indicated that essentially all the radioactivity in the expired volatiles was unchanged D5. Repeated exposure gave rise to higher levels of parent D5 in the lung and fat of both sexes and in female liver relative to the single exposure. Immediately after sacrifice approximately 50% of the radioactivity was parent. Five polar metabolites of D5 were identified in urine, with no parent D5 detected. The urine had polar silanols. Radiochromatograms had two peaks in feces. One corresponded to the retention time for D5. The second has been tentatively identified as hydroxylated D5. In contrast to D4, the PBPK modeling for D5 requires description of a stable metabolite, called HO-D5, and a polar metabolite pool that is rapidly eliminated to urine. The concentration of stable metabolite in liver, lung and plasma was too low for unequivocal chemical determination. The amount of metabolites in the plasma, liver, lungs and fat was estimated by subtracting the concentration of chemical determined using GC/MS from the concentration determined using radiochemical detection. Despite the nose-only exposure design, a significant amount of D5 was deposited on the fur of the animals following either single or multiple exposures to D5. This, in combination with the distribution to the gastrointestinal tract suggesting ingestion of the compound, led to an additional experiment (Ref. 70). Groups of 4 to 5 male and female animals were exposed to air (nose only) containing 160 ppm 14C-D5 for 6 hours. Immediately following exposure, one group of males and one group of females, were euthanized while still loaded in the exposure chamber, then transferred to metabolism cages for 6 hours, and used to determine levels of 14C-D5 off-gassed from the pelt. The total body burden of both radioactivity and parent chemical from these animals was compared with the results from two additional groups of males and females that were not sacrificed and moved immediately following the exposure period into individual Roth style glass metabolism cages. Urine, faeces and expired air were collected from each live animal at various time points up to 168-hours post-exposure. As close as possible to the 168-hour post-exposure time point, animals were euthanized, tissues collected, and the remaining carcasses were solubilized. In the animals that were euthanized before removal from the exposure chambers, significant amounts of D5 were measured in the cages and the volatile traps for both males and females, indicating volatilization of D5 from the animal’s fur. However, the deposition rate of D5 collected in the expired air via volatile traps was greater for the euthanized than for the live rats. It was noted that after the rats were moved to metabolism cages, routine grooming could result in ingestion of D5 from the fur, reducing the amount of D5 available for evaporation from the fur of the live animals that could contribute to continued post- exposure inhalation of D5. This ingestion of D5 during grooming is also supported by the amounts of radioactivity measured in the gastrointestinal tract of the animals exposed to 14C-D5 via inhalation. The mass balance, as a percentage of total recovered amounts, in the live animals measured in this experiment was different than noted in the initial single exposure study (ref. 69) with a higher fraction of the recovered radioactivity in the expired air. This could be attributed to the immediate transfer of the animals to metabolism cages increasing the capture of expired volatiles from exhalation and volatilization from the pelt.",,rat/Fisher 344,,,,,,f & m,,106,,,,,,,,,,,LL014002,"test substance: D5 from Dow Corning, radio-labelled test substance : [14C]-D5",,990316A ,total activity 120 mCi ,"7, 160",ppm,,,,"inhalation , nose-only",repeated. 14 times 6hr exposures to unlabeled D5 followed by 1 time 6hr exposure to labelled D5 ,,,6h,,,,,,"

Qualitative assessment of tissue distribution (WBA) showed that the radioactivity was systematically available and distributed to major organs such as bone marrow, liver, kidney, and fat. Statistical analysis of blood curves showed significant difference between radioactivity and parent area under the curves (AUC) for both males and females when 14C-D5 was administrated in corn oil indicating presence of metabolites in the blood. Absorption of D5 was also compared between various carriers. Data obtained from the blood curve analysis showed that the test article was most readily absorbed when delivered in corn oil and least available for absorption when carried in the simethicone fluid The mass balanced data showed that 19.62%, 25.81% and 9.94% of administered 14C-D5 was absorbed when delivered in corn oil, in simethicone fluid or as neat 14C-D5 respectively. The majority of the absorbed dose was found in expired volatile traps particularly when the dose was delivered in simethicone fluid. The entire radioactivity expired was attributed to the parent compound. The discrepancy between absorption assessed by blood curve analysis and mass balance data analysis may be caused by evaporation of 14C-D5 from the excreted fecal matter that remained in the bottom of the cage. Animals dosed with corn oil and especially simethicone had a higher occurrence of loose fecal matter that adhered to the side of the cages.

Unlike D4, D5 is metabolized to a stable, lipophilic cyclic metabolite, possibly hydroxyl-D5 (ref 81). Two major metabolites and five minor metabolites have been identified in the urine of female rats administered 14C-D5 orally.

Fig. 1: Possible pathways for the formation of the metabolites of D5 in Fischer 344 rat urine (from Varaprath et al., 2003) While D5 is very lipophilic, the studies show that it has a high rate of clearance, both by metabolism and exhalation. Comparison of blood and tissue concentrations after 14 days of exposure (ref 71) indicates a lack of bioaccumulation of this compound in the rat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"PBPK models: To understand the influence of kinetic factors on delivered dose of these siloxanes, a comprehensive set of kinetic studies were conducted over the last several years. In association with development of these kinetic data, seven PBPK models have been published describing the biological and physicochemical processes regulating the kinetic disposition of either D4 or D5 in various species after different routes of exposure (Andersen et al., 2001; Reddy et al., 2003; Sarangapani et al., 2003; ENVIRON 2005; Reddy et al., 2007; Reddy et al., 2008; Tobin et al., 2008). The individual models were each developed with specific datasets to describe the kinetic behavior of either D4 or D5 in either rats or humans following various routes of administration. Table 5 (taken from Yang et al., 2012): Summary of existing rodent and human PBPK models for D4 and D5 The first modeling work by Andersen et al. (2001) uncovered a variety of unique processes that regulate siloxane kinetics in the rodent following inhalation compared to other volatile organic compounds. Among those characteristics were low blood:air partitioning, high fat:blood partitioning, high metabolic clearance by the liver, and slower loss of D4 from tissues than expected for simple well-mixed, flow-limited uptake compartments. In addition, a discrepancy between the rate of D4 elimination via exhalation and the associated blood levels following inhalation exposure indicated the presence of a pool of D4 in the plasma that was not available for exhalation. These observations led to inclusion of several ‘deep- tissue compartments’ to account for slow, multi-phasic loss after cessation of exposure, a pool (compartment) in blood assumed to represent lipoproteins, called a mobile lipid pool (MLP), and multiple fat compartments to describe the longer-time exhalation curves indicative of slower release of D4 from fat compartments. D5 has greater lipophilicity and lower blood:air partitioning than D4. The process of fitting a PBPK model to the rat inhalation studies with D5 required addition of other deep tissue compartments and deep tissue stores within the blood compartment. Thus, the rat D5 inhalation description (Reddy et al., 2008) has the largest number of tissue compartments of all the siloxane PBPK models. The dermal studies and the human volunteer studies do not have sufficient resolution to require expansion of the number of compartments. The dermal studies provide information to characterize the dynamics of uptake at the skin surface (Reddy et al., 2007) and the human inhalation studies, especially with D4, provided time- course information for metabolites that was not available from the rat studies (Reddy et al., 2003). The published human models for D4 (Reddy et al., 2003, 2007) and D5 (Reddy et al., 2007, 2008) simulated the time-course biomarker data of D4 and D5 collected during inhalation or dermal exposure. Compared to the rat models, human models had a simpler structure due to the more limited data sets that can be obtained from human volunteers. Due to these differences, the compartmental structures included in the models varied according to available data sets and the goals of model development. As more data became available, the model structures have been modified and updated. This variety of models, however, presents challenges when wanting to use these models for human health risk assessments because it is difficult to determine which models structures to use to compare internal dose metrics across compounds and species. To improve the utility of these models for risk assessment, a single multi-route and multi-species siloxane PBPK model was built in which the key chemical-specific biological and kinetic features determined in previous PBPK models were preserved (Yang et al., 2012 - ref 84). The harmonized rat model structure describes the extensive set of kinetic data on the time– course concentrations of total radiolabeled D4 and D5 in exhaled breath, blood, several tissues and urine during and following a both single and multiple exposure levels at several concentrations in rats using a consistent set of chemical and species specific parameters. To ensure consistency between the updated multi-purpose model and the original D4 and D5 models, the model estimated time-averaged plasma and liver concentrations in the rat following 160 ppm D5 and 700 ppm D4, possible dose metrics for risk assessment, were compared with the values obtained in the original PBPK models and determined to be consistent. Once a harmonized model structure was developed using inhalation studies in the rats and human volunteers for siloxanes, the inhalation model was expanded to accommodate dermal absorption where the biochemical and metabolism parameters were consistent between the exposure routes. A skin application model was added and used to simulate input of D5 from dermal exposure. Once the chemicals enter the systemic circulation, they were assumed to follow the same kinetics as the chemicals absorbed from inhalation. The harmonized model consists of six tissue compartments including blood, lung, liver, slowly perfused tissues, and rapidly perfused tissues (Figure 2). Figure 2: Diagram of the multi-purpose D4/D5 PBPK model structure that describes (a) the time –course tissue concentrations of D4 and D5 (b) hydroxylated D5 metabolite sub-model (c) short chain silanol metabolite sub-model (d) production and distribution of the mobile lipid pool (e) dermal uptake of D4 and D5 in humans. Cyclic volatiles methylsiloxanes (VMSs) are extensively cleared from the body via exhalation of free parent material and hepatic metabolism to various polar silanol metabolites. As discovered in previous modeling efforts, the measured plasma concentrations of parent siloxane represent both a bound, sequestered pool of siloxane and a free, circulating portion of the siloxane that is available for distribution to other tissues and exhalation from the lung. In the model, this unavailable pool of material is described as a portion of parent siloxane bound to lipids such as blood lipoproteins, a hypothesis that still needs to be experimentally determined. The current model describes hepatic metabolism as a dose-dependent, saturable process and simulates the time-course concentrations of both parent siloxane and total silanol metabolites separate from total radiolabeled equivalents. For D5, circulating blood and tissue concentrations of the hydroxylated D5 metabolite are also described. For the parameterization of the harmonized D4/D5 Rat inhalation model, the datasets used for D5 are the tissue time-course data for total radioactivity and parent chemical from 14C- D5 inhalation studies in male and female rats that were collected following a single (either at 7 or 160 ppm) inhalation exposure for 6 hr/day or multiple exposure at 160 ppm (see above Tobin et al., 2008). The time series data included exhaled breath, tissues of blood, liver, fat, and lung, urine, and feces. For the human data, the datasets were issued from the study on 3 male and 2 females subjects exposed to D5 vapor at 10 ppm for 1 hour. During the exposure, subjects performed intermittent exercise alternating rest and exercise periods on regular interval. The corresponding changes in the ventilation rate and the minute volume were recorded. Blood and exhaled breath samples were collected during the exposure and the post- exposure period up to 24h after the cessation of the exposure. The dermal exposure route was then added to the model following parameterization of the inhalation model. The Reddy et al. (2007) model and associated data sets were used to describe the skin compartment and simulate the dermal uptake data from human volunteers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Following the consultation period and to answer specific requests from the SCCS, the following documents and software used to develop the PB-PK models were provided by the applicant and assessed by SCCS: - Tobin, J.M., Mcnett, D.A., Durham, J.A., Plotzke, K.P., 2008.

WHO (2010) provides guidance on the characterization and application of PBPK models in risk assessment. McMullin (2016) provide a Table (Table 5 in the paper and Table 1 in the addendum) with responses of key questions for assessing the level of confidence according to the WHO guidance: Table 1: WHO Questions for Assessing the Level of Confidence in the use of a PBPK Model: WHO (2010) KEY QUESTION: D5 PBPK Model:  Level of  Confidence;  Does the model structure and parameters have a reasonable biological basis?:  Yes. Model structure, code and parameters have appropriate biological bases and do not violate any modeling principles or known boundary conditions of biological processes: High SCCS agree; How well does the PBPK model reproduce the chemical-specific PK data under various experimental or exposure conditions?: This model consistently reproduces the general trend of the following data using a single set of species and chemical specific parameters for all the data: • multiple dose levels • oral, dermal and inhalation routes of exposures • rodents and humans. The model reproduces the most plausible dose metric associated with hazard endpoints used in the SCCS RA (parent D5 AUC in blood) separate from total material (parent + metabolites): High SCCS agree; How reliable is the PBPK model with regard to its predictions of dose metrics relevant to risk assessment? :The model reliably reproduces the most plausible dose metric associated with hazard endpoints used in the SCCS RA (parent D5 AUC in blood) separate from total material (parent + metabolites) in both rats and humans at relevant dose levels (within the range of known pharmacokinetic linearity) and relevant exposure routes for consumers (inhalation and dermal): High SCCS agree. SCCS re-estimated the Cmax and AUC with the human D5 PBPK model following inhalation exposure of humans to 10 ppm and then compared with the AUC and Cmax calculated .Concentration  ppm:  Dose metric Cmax (mg/l)  Observed* Predicted** : AUC (mg x h /l)  Observed* Predicted**;  10 :  0.052*  0.056**: 0.34* 0.17** (*values calculated from the Table 1-2 for human with Phoenix software, ** predicted with the PBPK model provided by the applicant (code for D5 and human) following 1h inhalation exposure. The sensitivity analysis has been well assessed according the WHO guidance: because parameter could be sensitive at different times, sensitivity analysis was performed and values were calculated at different times for a single exposure simulation. The human data were used for calibration of the human PBPK model; under these considerations, additional model evaluation aspects are needed regarding the reliability (model testing, uncertainty and sensitivity) as described and recommended by WHO 2012 in figure 10. This evaluation allow that when a human PBPK model is not evaluated with empirical data, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are conducted to determine the reliability of PBPK model prediction. Conclusion for human PBPK model: The model does reproduce the peak concentration (Cmax) and the AUC described in the McMullin study. Even if there are discrepancies between the predictions and the observed experimental data in AUC, the ratio (Ratio predicted/observed) is less than 2, which is acceptable according the WHO guidance. Therefore, the SCCS considers that the model is suitable for risk assessment.",,no,,,,

The SCCS agrees with the conclusion of the sccp and therefore, the submitted toxicokinetic studies have not been evaluated by the sccs in this opinion. Overall SCCS conclusion on oral absorption based on the toxicokinetic studies: As the toxicokinetic studies could not be evaluated by the SCCS (see the SCCS comments above), the oral absorption of cetylpyridinium chloride from mouthwashes, cosmetic products containing up to 0.1% cetylpyridinium chloride or from all other oral hygiene cosmetic products containing up to 0.5% (w/w) cetylpyridinium chloride cannot be estimated. According to the notes of guidance, 50% oral absorption is used in case inadequate data on oral absorption are available. However, if there is evidence to suggest poor oral bioavailability, it may be more appropriate to assume that only 10% of the administered dose is systemically available. From the submitted oral toxicokinetic study in rats, the oral absorption was estimated to be approximately 14% following administration of 25 mg/kg bw cetylpyridinium chloride as a single dose by gavage.

This conclusion is mainly based on results obtained from determination of urinary and/or faecal excretion of iodine and/or erythrosine after ingestion. While only minor amounts of ingested erythrosine/iodine are excreted via urine, the major part is excreted via faeces, which led to different, albeit mainly coherent findings with regards to oral bioavailability/absorption (Katamine et al., 1987: oral absorption not higher than 1 %, Ingbar, 1984: urinary excretion of erythrosine after intake of radiolabelled substance: 0.38% maximally, radioactivity in faeces: 80 – 103%, maximum body retention detected in a 14d observation period: 1.7 %). The findings of the Ingbar (1983) study indicate that low amounts absorbed after repeated oral administration of erythrosine (based on increased serum iodine levels), are not associated with effects on thyroid parameters. In a more poorly described study (Bernstein et al., 1975) it was concluded that oral bioavailability of erythrosine is not higher than 7.8 %. From one poorly described study it can be assumed, that a small fraction of bioavailable erythrosine (up to 1.7 %) can be excreted via bile. Low bioavailability (about 1%) of erythrosine was also obtained after comprehensive pharmacokinetic evaluation of data from studies  yielding AUC (area under the curve) values (Poulsen, 1993). Investigations in humans demonstrate rapid and quantitative elimination of erythrosine within 14 days, indicating low potential for accumulation. The lack of accumulation is further supported by results from tissue distribution analysis in animal experiments. Erythrosine does not appear to be distributed widely and to a great extent into tissues. Amounts of radioactivity from radiolabelled erythrosine well below 1 % (of the applied radioactivity) could be determined in the liver; even lower amounts (about 0.01 %) were detectable in the thyroid. Apparently, there was no distribution into brain or pituitary. Some studies pointed to the fact, that minor amounts of ingested erythrosine might be metabolized. However, no quantitative figures on the extent of metabolism can be derived, and structural identification of possible metabolites is not possible based on the available studies.

For maximum TSH increment after TRH stimulation, there is some evidence of an effect at the highest dose (a slight but significant increase in the top dose group). Thus, a NOAEL of 60 mg/day was derived (for a 60 kg person this would be 1.0 mg/kg bw/day) (Gardner et al., 1987; Crump and Farrar, 1987).","The authors concluded, that the increase in TSH secretion induced by erythrosine was related to the antithyroid effect of increased serum iodide concentrations, rather than a direct effect of erythrosine on thyroid hormone secretion or peripheral metabolism.",human/healthy volunteers,,22-38,y,,,m,,10,,,,,,,,,,,Lot AC 7172,Test substance: Erythrosine (from Certified Colour Manufacturers Association),,,,"20, 60, 200 ",mg/day,,,,"oral, gelatine capsule",single daily for 14 days ( repeated),,,14d,,"Further urine samples, collected over 24 hr periods were used for urinalysis on day 8 and 15.

(2) Gardner et al. suggest that the increase of TSH secretion is rather due to increased levels of serum iodide than to the erythrosine molecule itself. However, in view of the results from toxicokinetic studies it seems to be unlikely that increased serum iodide is a consequence of erythrosine metabolism. Thus, it remains to be clarified whether and by which mechanism erythrosine might cause elevated serum iodide levels. A possible explanation has been given be Minegishi et al. (1986), see section 3.3.12- Special investigations. (3) The study had been approved by the Virginia Commonwealth University Committee on the conduct of human Research. (4) For better interpretation of the results, JECFA (1986) reports on a further study (Paul et al. (1987) which had been undertaken in order to determine whether relatively small supplementary amounts of iodine in the diet would affect thyroid function: “Normal, euthyroid human subjects received 250, 500 or 1500 µg iodine daily for 14 days; the doses were selected to correspond to the amounts of iodine that might be bioavailable from the doses of erythrosine used in the study by Gardner et al., 1987. Following administration of 1500 µg/day there were small but significant decreases in serum T4 and serum T3 concentration, a small compensatory increase in serum TSH concentrations and in the TSH response to TRH. However, all values remained within the normal range. In contrast, no changes occurred following daily administration of 250 or 500 µg I2.” From this, JECFA (1988) commented: “Additional human studies confirmed that erythrosine is poorly absorbed. The data did not indicate the mechanism by which erythrosine exerted its effect on the thyroid. However, it appeared that inorganic iodine per se was not the causative agent.”",1987,,,"Gardner et al., 1987; Crump and Farrar, 1987","Controls: pre-exposure values served as control values, Before the first administration, 24 hr urine samples had been collected (this day 1 urine sample was taken for urinalysis in order to obtain “baseline values”). TRH testing can demonstrate early, minimal disruption of the pituitary-thyroid axis before changes in basal serum TSH and thyroid hormone levels are evident. For the TRH test, individuals received a single bolus dose 500 µg TRH and samples for determination of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were taken at 15 min intervals for 1 hr. The TRH test was repeated on day 15. All results from complete blood count, blood chemistry and urinalysis obtained at day 1, 8 and 15 were considered normal. ",

EcoG+,https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_198.pdf,in vivo,non OECD,"Studies in humans and animals indicate that silver compounds are absorbed by the inhalation and oral routes and poorly by the dermal route. Absorbed silver is distributed widely throughout the body. Data on the extent of oral absorption is variable but is generally accepted to be relatively low. Juberg (1997) reports oral absorption values for silver in animal studies of less than 10%; WHO (2003) states that up to 5% of colloidal silver can be absorbed after oral exposure. Important factors in the absorption of silver include the presence and extent of silver-binding proteins and the solubility of the silver species (Juberg 1997). Lansdown (2010) states that passive gastrointestinal absorption of the free silver ion is unlikely to be significant due to its reactivity with sulphydryl, carboxyl, hydroxy and protein ligands on mucosal surfaces and cell debris. Silver readily reacts with organic constituents of food, which further limits its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. The extent of oral absorption is therefore variable but is estimated not to exceed 5- 10% and is thought likely to be influenced by factors such as the presence of food and gastrointestinal transit time (ATSDR, 1990).","The systemic distribution of orally absorbed silver is limited by extensive biliary excretion (first-pass effect) (Juberg, 1997). Absorbed silver is extensively bound to serum proteins including albumin and ceruloplasmin. Soluble silver ions may be deposited in tissues as insoluble salts such the silver chloride or silver phosphate (ATSDR, 1990); these insoluble salts are subsequently transformed to silver selenide and silver sulphide. Dermal silver deposits in one case of argyria were identified as being primarily composed of silver sulphide (Buckley et al, 1965). The characteristic blue or grey discoloration of skin exposed to sunlight in humans with argyria may be caused by the photoreduction of deposited insoluble silver salts to metallic silver (ATSDR, 1990). Studies in the rat have also characterised silver deposits in internal organs as the silver sulphide (Berry & Galle 1982). While deposition of silver has been observed in many organs and tissues, the liver and skin are identified as the main storage centres for silver in the body (ATSDR, 1990; Faust, 1992). Exposed experimental animals and humans show granular deposits containing silver in both pigmented and non-pigmented skin. In studies using injection of radiolabelled metallic silver and silver nitrate in the rat, the highest concentrations of silver were identified in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, blood, kidney, muscle, bone and then skin. The proportion of silver distributed to the tissues is positively correlated with the dose administered (ATSDR, 1990). Lansdown (2010) states that there is no convincing evidence for the passage of silver across the blood-brain-barrier or blood-CSF-barrier.","Systemically absorbed silver may bind to plasma proteins and is deposited in tissues as the insoluble silver chloride and phosphate, which are subsequently reduced to silver sulphide or silver selenide (ATSDR, 1990). Silver chloride deposited in exposed areas of skin may be photochemically reduced to metallic silver and subsequently oxidised by the tissue to form the black silver sulphide, resulting in skin discoloration.","Excretion of silver in experimental animals is mainly via the bile, with little urinary excretion (Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003). Biliary excretion is also the major route in humans, with urinary excretion of minor importance (Lansdown, 2010). Silver binds to and induces the expression of metallothioneins in the liver, thereby facilitating its biliary excretion. Cumulative excretion of silver in experimental animals (mice, rats, monkeys and dogs) ranged from 90-99%, with retention of up to 10%. Similar retention is observed in humans. Half-lives of approximately 50 days are reported for silver (Faust, 992; Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003). Whole-body retention studies in mice and monkeys following oral dosing with radiolabelled silver nitrate indicate that silver excretion in these species follows a biexponential profile with biological half-lives of 0.1 and 1.6 days in mice and 0.3 and 3 days in monkeys. In similarly exposed rats and dogs, silver excretion followed a triexponential profile with biological half-lives of 0.1, 0.7, and 5.9 days in rats and 0.1, 7.6, and 33.8 days in dogs (Furchner et al, 1968). Saturation of the elimination pathway in the liver occurring with chronic or high level acute exposure leads to excretion in the faeces decreasing and deposition in tissues increasing. Faust (1992) and ATSDR (1990) reported a study in dogs using intratracheal administration of metallic silver, the lung clearance of the metallic silver was accompanied by increased silver in the stomach and liver due to the mucociliary escalator and consequent ingestion. Dissolution of the silver into the blood was the main route of clearance from the lungs. Within 30 days, approximately 90% of the dose was excreted in the faeces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,multiple,,,,,,,,,,,,,,multiple,,
