moreover, the number 68.6% is higher than the absorption reported with occlusion. for the use of 10% degee in rinse-off product, sccs will use (17.5 + 3.9) 21.4% (see comment I). in the mos calculation for the hair dyes, sccs will in the case of oxidative hair dyes use (34.2 + 2 x 15.0) 64.2 µg/cm² and for the non-oxidative hair colorant formulation (9.9 + 2 x 3.8) 17.5 µg/cm². the addition of 2sd has been made due to the large difference found with the hair dye formulations compared to the other absorption studies. no explanation is available to account for the large
