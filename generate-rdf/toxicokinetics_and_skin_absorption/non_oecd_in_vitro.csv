Percutaneous penetration of 30.3% of the total applied dose of triclosan in an ethanol/water solution was measured 24 hours after application of the dose to human skin samples in a diffusion cell system [Moss et al., 2000 (21)]. Results from studies using skin samples in diffusion cells showed limited percutaneous absorption following application of triclosan to the skin surface in any of the formulations used. The amount of triclosan tested in most of these studies (0.2%) is within the range of anticipated concentrations in consumer products (from 0.15 to 0.3%). The low concentration in the soap solution study (0.02%) was intended to simulate actual-use conditions (i.e., a soap solution of 0.2% triclosan would be diluted with water when applied to the skin). Appropriate rinse steps were included in the rinse-off product studies. As recommended by SCCP guidelines (SCCP, 2006), calculations of dermal absorption included the amounts of triclosan recovered in the dermis and epidermis layers (i.e., the “remaining sample of skin” after removing the stratum corneum, represented by tape strips 1 to 20 in these studies) and the amount recovered in the receptor fluid. Table 37 presents a summary of the values from the in vitro studies conducted in human skin samples.

All metabolites separated by HPLC were more hydrophilic than the parent compound. Metabolism can be summarised as follows (according to CLH report, BASF 2013): In liver microsomes, oxidation or reduction of BMHCA to the corresponding acid (lysmerylic acid, M7) or alcohol (lysmersol, M9), the latter being further oxidised at its tert-butyl group (to yield M3), was observed. In hepatocytes, as dehydrogenation follow-up product of M7 (E)-3-(4-t-butyl-phenyl)-2-methyl-acrylic acid (M16) was observed. Further, p-t-butylbenzoic acid (TBBA, M15) and its glycine conjugate (p-t-butyl-hippuric acid; TBHA, M12) occurred in rodents. In addition to these metabolites, glucuronic acid conjugates of M3, M7, M9 and M16 were detected. Lysmerylic acid (M7) was the main metabolite in hepatocytes of all species. Significant species differences in metabolic profiles were noted for TBHA (M12; 4.9 – 27.1% in mice, 3.5 – 3.6% in rats, not in rabbits or humans) and TBBA (M15).

However, in humans compared to rats, only limited percutaneous absorption of BMHCA (in EtOH) could be observed in vivo (1.4% vs. 19%). Species-specific differences in the metabolism of BMHCA have been identified both in vitro and in vivo. Lysmerylic acid was the main hepatic metabolite in all species tested. Quantitative evaluation of metabolic profiles for different species in an in vitro metabolism study demonstrated much higher levels of TBBA formation by rat hepatocytes when compared to other species. In particular, TBBA levels observed in human hepatocytes were about 4-fold lower compared to rat hepatocytes at corresponding concentrations. Comparative assessment of the urinary metabolites in different animal species again uncovered differences in the urinary excretion of TBBA (and TBHA), with rats being the species that predominantly forms TBBA.

The SCCS considers that the available measurements of dermal absorption have a significant degree of uncertainty. Therefore an absorption of 0.5% will be used in the safety evaluation for the boric compounds discussed in this Opinion (representing the absorption of boric acid + 2 x SD [0.23 + 2 x 0.13%] from the study of Wester et al., 1998). This is in agreement with other recent risk assessment of borates in EU (EU, 2009a, ECHA, 2010). It should be noted that skin absorption is probably higher in case of damaged skin. The dermal absorption of disodium octaborate tetrahydrate was slightly lower than that for the other boron compounds, however the octaborate was applied at a higher concentration, and the percentage of absorption would probably be higher if lower concentrations had been used.

Conclusion on toxicokinetics and metabolism by the applicant: An in vitro metabolism study to determine the metabolism profile of Transcutol showed that DEGEE was slowly metabolized by rat hepatocytes to several different unidentified metabolite peaks that accounted for approximately 1-17% of the total radioactivity. Human hepatocytes did not metabolize DEGEE significantly. In vivo, the absorption, distribution and excretion of Transcutol® was investigated comparably in two strains of rats after a single oral or intravenous dose of 20 mg [14C]- DEGEE /kg bw each. It was demonstrated that the radioactivity was rapidly excreted in urine, irrespectively of sex and route of administration. After intravenous injection, the maximum plasma concentration of the radioactivity was observed 0.25 hours post dose, while after oral administration it was observed at 0.25 - 0.50 hours post dose. The plasma half-life corresponded to 37 to 84 hours and measurable concentrations were observed in almost of the tissues 168 hours post dose. The absolute bioavailability of the radioactivity is very high (79 — 95%). The tissue distribution of the radioactivity was characterised by high concentrations observed in pituitary, thyroid, adrenals and bone marrow with regards to the concentrations observed in blood / plasma (100 to 1000 times less) at the same sampling time. The radioactivity measured in tissues was significantly decreased at 48 hours. No biologically relevant differences were observed within both strains of rats. In studies on the metabolic fate and excretion of Transcutol it could be shown that after a single oral administration, 90% of the administered radioactivity was excreted in the urine within the first 24 hours and [14C]-DEGEE was intensively metabolised as only 3% of the urinary  excreted radioactivity correspond to unchanged compound. The two major urinary metabolites were identifiedas ethoxyethoxyacetic acid and diethylene glycol, which represented 83% and 5.4% of the excreted urinary radioactivity, respectively. In plasma, only ethoxyethoxyacetic acid and unchanged [14C]-DEGEE were detected. ",
