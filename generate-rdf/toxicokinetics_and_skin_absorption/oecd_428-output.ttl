        ont:sccs_comment_to_test       "3 H-labelled triclosan has been used to examine percutaneous absorption in a number of in vitro studies. Percutaneous penetration of 30.3% of the total applied dose of triclosan in an ethanol/water solution was measured 24 hours after application of the dose to human skin samples in a diffusion cell system [Moss et al., 2000 (21)]. Results from studies using skin samples in diffusion cells showed limited percutaneous absorption following application of triclosan to the skin surface in any of the formulations used. The amount of triclosan tested in most of these studies (0.2%) is within the range of anticipated concentrations in consumer products (from 0.15 to 0.3%). The low concentration in the soap solution study (0.02%) was intended to simulate actual-use conditions (i.e., a soap solution of 0.2% triclosan would be diluted with water when applied to the skin). Appropriate rinse steps were included in the rinse-off product studies. As recommended by SCCP guidelines (SCCP, 2006), calculations of dermal absorption included the amounts of triclosan recovered in the dermis and epidermis layers (i.e., the “remaining sample of skin” after removing the stratum corneum, represented by tape strips 1 to 20 in these studies) and the amount recovered in the receptor fluid. Table 37 presents a summary of the values from the in vitro studies conducted in human skin samples. The results from the autoradiography study [Black et al., 1975 (27)] indicated no significant differences in the low levels of percutaneous absorption between different soap vehicles or between single versus multiple applications [Black et al., 1975 (27)]. Overall, the dermal absorption of triclosan was shown in these in vitro studies to be lower in human skin than in rat (7.2 to 30.3% versus 41.2% in studies in rats, including the data from the study using ethanol/water formulation)]." ;

Succeeding tape-strips (strips 4-20) contained 6.8% of the applied dose (0.25 µg/cm2) and 7.4% of the dose was recovered from the remainder of the sample of skin (0.28±0.05 µg/cm2)." ;

It is not acceptable to consider the stratum germinativum (the basal layer) as part of the “horny layer”, i.e. a structure from which the tested compound will be exfoliated. * the study is not in accordance with the sccs requirements.

Percutaneous penetration of 30.3% of the total applied dose of triclosan in an ethanol/water solution was measured 24 hours after application of the dose to human skin samples in a diffusion cell system [Moss et al., 2000 (21)]. Results from studies using skin samples in diffusion cells showed limited percutaneous absorption following application of triclosan to the skin surface in any of the formulations used. The amount of triclosan tested in most of these studies (0.2%) is within the range of anticipated concentrations in consumer products (from 0.15 to 0.3%). The low concentration in the soap solution study (0.02%) was intended to simulate actual-use conditions (i.e., a soap solution of 0.2% triclosan would be diluted with water when applied to the skin). Appropriate rinse steps were included in the rinse-off product studies. As recommended by SCCP guidelines (SCCP, 2006), calculations of dermal absorption included the amounts of triclosan recovered in the dermis and epidermis layers (i.e., the “remaining sample of skin” after removing the stratum corneum, represented by tape strips 1 to 20 in these studies) and the amount recovered in the receptor fluid. Table 37 presents a summary of the values from the in vitro studies conducted in human skin samples. The results from the autoradiography study [Black et al., 1975 (27)] indicated no significant differences in the low levels of percutaneous absorption between different soap vehicles or between single versus multiple applications [Black et al., 1975 (27)]. Overall, the dermal absorption of triclosan was shown in these in vitro studies to be lower in human skin than in rat (7.2 to 30.3% versus 41.2% in studies in rats, including the data from the study using ethanol/water formulation)]." ;

        ont:sccs_comment_to_test       "3 H-labelled triclosan has been used to examine percutaneous absorption in a number of in vitro studies. Percutaneous penetration of 30.3% of the total applied dose of triclosan in an ethanol/water solution was measured 24 hours after application of the dose to human skin samples in a diffusion cell system [Moss et al., 2000 (21)]. Results from studies using skin samples in diffusion cells showed limited percutaneous absorption following application of triclosan to the skin surface in any of the formulations used. The amount of triclosan tested in most of these studies (0.2%) is within the range of anticipated concentrations in consumer products (from 0.15 to 0.3%). The low concentration in the soap solution study (0.02%) was intended to simulate actual-use conditions (i.e., a soap solution of 0.2% triclosan would be diluted with water when applied to the skin). Appropriate rinse steps were included in the rinse-off product studies. As recommended by SCCP guidelines (SCCP, 2006), calculations of dermal absorption included the amounts of triclosan recovered in the dermis and epidermis layers (i.e., the “remaining sample of skin” after removing the stratum corneum, represented by tape strips 1 to 20 in these studies) and the amount recovered in the receptor fluid. Table 37 presents a summary of the values from the in vitro studies conducted in human skin samples. The results from the autoradiography study [Black et al., 1975 (27)] indicated no significant differences in the low levels of percutaneous absorption between different soap vehicles or between single versus multiple applications [Black et al., 1975 (27)]. Overall, the dermal absorption of triclosan was shown in these in vitro studies to be lower in human skin than in rat (7.2 to 30.3% versus 41.2% in studies in rats, including the data from the study using ethanol/water formulation)]." ;

Succeeding tape-strips (strips 4-20) contained 13.2% of the applied dose (0.50 µg/cm2 ), and 6.8% of the dose was recovered from the remainder of the sample of skin (0.27±0.09 µg/cm2 )." ;

In summary, the dermal absorption of DHA contained in typical self-tanning formulations was estimated to be 27.5 % (18.0 µg/cm2 ), 27.7 % (34.0 µg/cm2 ), 31.0 % (49.5 µg/cm2 ) and 37.2 % (84.4 µg/cm2 ) of the applied dose at DHA concentrations of 2.5, 5, 7 and 10%, respectively." ;

        ont:sccs_comment_to_test       "Comment (2):Two in vitro studies on percutaneous absorption through human skin are available for the intended use in hair dye product. The contact time was 30 min in both studies. 34.18 ± 14.99 µg/cm² (2.4 ± 1.1%) was absorbed in the study with the oxidative hair colorant formulation using 7% DEGEE (total recovery 100%) and 9.89 ± 3.75 µg/cm² (0.9 ± 0.4%) was absorbed with the non-oxidative hair colorant formulation using 5% DEGEE (total recovery 100%). It is noted that no oxidative agent (hydrogen peroxide) was present in the oxidative hair colorant. general comment: a dermal absorption of the order of 50% after 24 h exposure was reported in all studies submitted for the opinion in 2006 (21, 22). in one experiment with 30 min contact time the dermal absorption was about 20% with shampoo formulations (20). this latter study may be compared with the new experiments with hair dye formulations, where a dermal absorption of 1 – 2% was reported (49). the sccs finds it difficult to explain the large difference between these results since the concentrations of degee in the formulations used were in the same range in both studies. one factor that may contribute to the difference is that 5 mg/cm² of the formulations was applied to the filter in the first experiments while 20 mg/cm² was used in the experiments with the hair dye formulations. the applicant applies for the use of 5.5% degee in leave-on cosmetic products. two experiments relevant for this use with 10 cells each have been performed. in the first experiment the mean absorption was 56.1±12.5% and in the second experiment 44.4±5.1%. if the two studies are considered together (altogether 20 cells), the mean absorption will be 50.0±11.0% with an upper 95% confidence value of 55.1% (22). the study carried out with occlusion is not satisfactory reported with standard deviations. conclusions: in the mos calculation for use of 5.5% degee in leave-on cosmetic products sccs will use (56.1 + 12.5) 68.6%. this is considered a conservative estimate as the upper 95% confidence value when using both experiments together (20 cells) is 55.1%. moreover, the number 68.6% is higher than the absorption reported with occlusion. for the use of 10% degee in rinse-off product, sccs will use (17.5 + 3.9) 21.4% (see comment I). in the mos calculation for the hair dyes, sccs will in the case of oxidative hair dyes use (34.2 + 2 x 15.0) 64.2 µg/cm² and for the non-oxidative hair colorant formulation (9.9 + 2 x 3.8) 17.5 µg/cm². the addition of 2sd has been made due to the large difference found with the hair dye formulations compared to the other absorption studies. no explanation is available to account for the large difference. summary of dermal absorption studies with degee: shampoo (rinse off) (20): incubation time: 30 min, concentration % - µg/cm²: 5 – 279, 10 – 530, dermal absorption µg/cm² - %: 60.5 ± 22.3 - 21.6 ± 10.6, 92.9 ± 20.8 - 17.5 ± 3.9, recovery %: 91,91. hydro-alcoholic gel (leave-on) (21): incubation time: 24h, concentration % - µg/cm²: 15 – 831, 15 – 859, dermal absorption µg/cm² - %: 425 ± 85 - 51.0 ± 9.1, 385 ± 46 44.9 ± 4.8, recovery %: 52,46. repeated under occlusion (21): incubation time: 24h, concentration % - µg/cm²: 15 - Ca 890, dermal absorption µg/cm² - % : 459 - 51.5, recovery % : 92. emulsified formulations (leave-on) first exp.

Percutaneous penetration of 30.3% of the total applied dose of triclosan in an ethanol/water solution was measured 24 hours after application of the dose to human skin samples in a diffusion cell system [Moss et al., 2000 (21)]. Results from studies using skin samples in diffusion cells showed limited percutaneous absorption following application of triclosan to the skin surface in any of the formulations used. The amount of triclosan tested in most of these studies (0.2%) is within the range of anticipated concentrations in consumer products (from 0.15 to 0.3%). The low concentration in the soap solution study (0.02%) was intended to simulate actual-use conditions (i.e., a soap solution of 0.2% triclosan would be diluted with water when applied to the skin). Appropriate rinse steps were included in the rinse-off product studies. As recommended by SCCP guidelines (SCCP, 2006), calculations of dermal absorption included the amounts of triclosan recovered in the dermis and epidermis layers (i.e., the “remaining sample of skin” after removing the stratum corneum, represented by tape strips 1 to 20 in these studies) and the amount recovered in the receptor fluid. Table 37 presents a summary of the values from the in vitro studies conducted in human skin samples. The results from the autoradiography study [Black et al., 1975 (27)] indicated no significant differences in the low levels of percutaneous absorption between different soap vehicles or between single versus multiple applications [Black et al., 1975 (27)]. Overall, the dermal absorption of triclosan was shown in these in vitro studies to be lower in human skin than in rat (7.2 to 30.3% versus 41.2% in studies in rats, including the data from the study using ethanol/water formulation)]." ;

The contact time was 30 min in both studies. 34.18 ± 14.99 µg/cm² (2.4 ± 1.1%) was absorbed in the study with the oxidative hair colorant formulation using 7% DEGEE (total recovery 100%) and 9.89 ± 3.75 µg/cm² (0.9 ± 0.4%) was absorbed with the non-oxidative hair colorant formulation using 5% DEGEE (total recovery 100%). It is noted that no oxidative agent (hydrogen peroxide) was present in the oxidative hair colorant. general comment: a dermal absorption of the order of 50% after 24 h exposure was reported in all studies submitted for the opinion in 2006 (21, 22). in one experiment with 30 min contact time the dermal absorption was about 20% with shampoo formulations (20). this latter study may be compared with the new experiments with hair dye formulations, where a dermal absorption of 1 – 2% was reported (49). the sccs finds it difficult to explain the large difference between these results since the concentrations of degee in the formulations used were in the same range in both studies. one factor that may contribute to the difference is that 5 mg/cm² of the formulations was applied to the filter in the first experiments while 20 mg/cm² was used in the experiments with the hair dye formulations. the applicant applies for the use of 5.5% degee in leave-on cosmetic products. two experiments relevant for this use with 10 cells each have been performed. in the first experiment the mean absorption was 56.1±12.5% and in the second experiment 44.4±5.1%. if the two studies are considered together (altogether 20 cells), the mean absorption will be 50.0±11.0% with an upper 95% confidence value of 55.1% (22). the study carried out with occlusion is not satisfactory reported with standard deviations. conclusions: in the mos calculation for use of 5.5% degee in leave-on cosmetic products sccs will use (56.1 + 12.5) 68.6%. this is considered a conservative estimate as the upper 95% confidence value when using both experiments together (20 cells) is 55.1%. moreover, the number 68.6% is higher than the absorption reported with occlusion. for the use of 10% degee in rinse-off product, sccs will use (17.5 + 3.9) 21.4% (see comment I). in the mos calculation for the hair dyes, sccs will in the case of oxidative hair dyes use (34.2 + 2 x 15.0) 64.2 µg/cm² and for the non-oxidative hair colorant formulation (9.9 + 2 x 3.8) 17.5 µg/cm². the addition of 2sd has been made due to the large difference found with the hair dye formulations compared to the other absorption studies. no explanation is available to account for the large difference. summary of dermal absorption studies with degee: shampoo (rinse off) (20): incubation time: 30 min, concentration % - µg/cm²: 5 – 279, 10 – 530, dermal absorption µg/cm² - %: 60.5 ± 22.3 - 21.6 ± 10.6, 92.9 ± 20.8 - 17.5 ± 3.9, recovery %: 91,91. hydro-alcoholic gel (leave-on) (21): incubation time: 24h, concentration % - µg/cm²: 15 – 831, 15 – 859, dermal absorption µg/cm² - %: 425 ± 85 - 51.0 ± 9.1, 385 ± 46 44.9 ± 4.8, recovery %: 52,46. repeated under occlusion (21): incubation time: 24h, concentration % - µg/cm²: 15 - Ca 890, dermal absorption µg/cm² - % : 459 - 51.5, recovery % : 92. emulsified formulations (leave-on) first exp.
