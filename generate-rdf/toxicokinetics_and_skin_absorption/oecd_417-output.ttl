Given its physicochemical properties, BMHCA is likely to have high bioavailability via the oral route. After oral and dermal administration to experimental animals and humans (cf. section 3.3.4.2.), there is clear evidence of systemic absorption of BMHCA. However, in humans compared to rats, only limited percutaneous absorption of BMHCA (in EtOH) could be observed in vivo (1.4% vs. 19%). Species-specific differences in the metabolism of BMHCA have been identified both in vitro and in vivo. Lysmerylic acid was the main hepatic metabolite in all species tested. Quantitative evaluation of metabolic profiles for different species in an in vitro metabolism study demonstrated much higher levels of TBBA formation by rat hepatocytes when compared to other species. In particular, TBBA levels observed in human hepatocytes were about 4-fold lower compared to rat hepatocytes at corresponding concentrations. Comparative assessment of the urinary metabolites in different animal species again uncovered differences in the urinary excretion of TBBA (and TBHA), with rats being the species that predominantly forms TBBA. However, the differences observed between rats and monkeys did not mirror the 4-fold difference in TBBA formation as seen with rat and human liver microsomes in vitro." ;
