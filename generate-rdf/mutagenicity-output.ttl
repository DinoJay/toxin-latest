This response was evaluated as positive because the revertant counts demonstrated a dose response, yielding average revertant counts of 4 for the vehicle, 6 to 8 at 5.0 to 50 μg per plate and 13 to 15 at 150 to 200 μg per plate, with the maximum revertant counts being outside of the upper 95% control limit of 13. No precipitate was observed. Toxicity was observed beginning at 300 μg per plate. This repeat experiment meets the criteria for a positive response in TA1537 in the absence of S9 activation. " .
