GC-MS quantitation of the impurities should also be provided based on the GC-MS data presented in the report. hydroquinone content should be accurately quantified in each batch and be at unavoidable trace level in each batch. stability of 1,2,4-THB in solution depends on the amount of dissolved oxygen in the solution. if the solution has been thoroughly degassed and is stored in an inert atmosphere or in a sealed container, the material will be stable until oxygen exposure is allowed. once oxygen is available, the molecule will undergo oxidation and condense with itself to form dimers and oligomers in the absence of primary intermediates. Black particulate matter of high molecular weight precipitates out of the solution and settles to the bottom. in view of the reactivity of 1,2,4-THB with oxygen, these hair dye formulations are filled into specialised, oxygen-barrier packaging for commercialisation. stability tests are conducted under standard conditions (both room and elevated temperature) appropriate for cosmetic products. final product stability meets standard requirements until the package is opened by the consumer for use. upon dispensing and application, the combination of dyes (including 1,2,4-THB and precursors) in the formulation undergo oxidative reactions as is predicted by their chemical structure. stability of 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene in typical hair dye formulations was not reported except the reaction of 1,2,4-THB in the presence of the primary intermediate PTD (A5), which was studied as a representative example of oxidative coupling with primary intermediates in general. in response to the request for clarification from the SCCS on uses of 1,2,4-THB, the applicant confirmed that 1,2,4-THB is intended to be used in the presence of primary intermediates such as p-phenylenediamine (A7), p-toluenediamine (PTD)(A5), N,N bis–(2-hydroxyethyl) pphenylenediamine (A50) and p-aminophenol (A16), just to name a few. this is done to achieve a range of desired permanent colours, and the particular primary intermediate or combination thereof will depend on the desired shade. it was also confirmed that the only study conducted in the presence of a primary intermediate was the dermal absorption work, which evaluated dermal absorption with the 1,2,4-THB in a simple formulation with PTD (A5).  All other studies submitted for the safety evaluation of 1,2,4-THB were conducted with 1,2,4THB alone. ",

","vitamin A is used as a cosmetic ingredient at maximum use concentrations of 0.05%(retinol equivalents) in body lotions, 0.3% (retinol equivalents) in hand and face creams as well as in other leave on or rinse-off products. these products are usually presented as anti -wrinkle products. retinoic acid is banned in cosmetic products in the EU whatever the concentration (Annex 2,entry 375). analytics: recently, a novel sensitive analytical method was reported, including reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection for the quantification of retinol, retinyl palmitate, and retinoic acid in cosmetic preparations with respective recoveries from spiked cosmetic products of 95% or higher (Hubinger JC (2009) Determination of retinol, retinyl palmitate and retinoic acid in consumer cosmetic products, J. Cosmet. Sci., 60, 485-500) . the author emphasised that the method may be used to quantitatively determine several retinoids and their isomers in cosmetic products but it is unclear if the HPLC method has been applied to the analysis of the batches used in toxicity testing. this method does not include retinyl acetate, retinyl linoleate or retinal. calculations use international units (IUs) or retinol equivalents (REs). a conversion of the individual derivatives into IUs can be found as follow: 1IU of vitamin A corresponds to vitamin A derivative 1IU corresponds to 0.300 μg of retinol, to 0.345 μg retinyl acetate, to 0.359 μg retinyl propionate, and to 0.550 μg of retinyl palmitate",

","subm. 2: none identified. subm. 3: presence of residual process chemicals was investigated during analysis of 18 samples in 2015. according to the applicant, acetic anhydride, acetic acid or any other residual solvents were not detected. the post process, likely fractionation, is the main parameter which contributes to the elimination of such potential residual traces. water content was not measured but no evidence of cyclohexane, hexane or citric acid was detected in the samples. as such, it can be concluded that residual process chemicals are absent from acetylated vetiver oil (avo) supplied to the fragrance industry. analytical investigations performed on 18 commercial samples were free of these impurities. acetic anhydride, acetic acid or any other residual solvents were not detected. the post process, likely fractionation, is the main parameter which contributes to the elimination of such potential residual traces.",not applicable (mixture),not applicable (mixture),not applicable (mixture),"subm. 2: not submitted. subm. 3: partition coefficients n-octanol/water of vetiveryl acetate 112 extra, for the 17 compounds that had relative areas of >1%, were: logPow in the range of 2.6 to 7.1.

(specific gravity, refractive index, colour, odour) and gc comparison. as an example, gc profiles from the same batch of avo (sample 1; not stabilised with antioxidant) measured at 0 and 14 months (a 12 month shelf-life is claimed) showed no significant change over this time period.","subm. 2:fragrance in perfumes and in cosmetics with following limits: category 1 (lip products) 0.07%,category 2 (deodorants/antiperspirants) 0.08%, category 3(hydro-alcoholic products for shaved skin) 0.35%, category 4 (hydro-alcoholic products for unshaved skin) 1.04%, category 5 (women facial cream, facial make up, hand cream) 0.55%, category 6 (mouthwash, toothpaste) 1.67%, category 8 (make up remover, nail care) 2.00%, category 9 (shampoo, rinse-off conditioner, bar soap) 5.00%. subm. 3: acetylated vetiver oil (avo), as used, is a mixture of many constituents, resulting from acetylation of crude vetiver oil. avo is used as a fragrance in perfumes and in cosmetics. maximum use concentration of avo in various types of cosmetic products is described in the following table below (provided by the applicant). according to the applicant, these are the maximum concentrations they would like to defend in different cosmetic product categories. they have incorporated the product category of hydroalcoholic based fragrances/perfumes, which is of critical importance for them but not yet part of the systemic exposure calculation table as contained in the sccs notes of guidance (2016) to derive the margin of safety. product type: % acetylated vetiver oil (avo) in consumer product; hydroalcoholic-based fragrances (e.g. eau de toilette, perfume, aftershave, cologne): 0.90; deodorants: 0.05; make up products (e.g. eye make-up, make-up remover, liquid foundation, mascara, eyeliner, lipstick): 0.05; face cream: 0.10; hand cream: 0.10; body lotion: 0.10; hair styling: 0.10; bath cleansing products (e.g. soaps, shower gel, rinse-off conditioner, shampoo): 0.20","subm. 2: since the compound is a mixture, solubility and  molecular weight are not applicable. vetiver oils of different origin (India, Indonesia, Haiti, Brazil etc) may have a different composition. the quality of commercial vetiver oils may differ considerably since several varieties of the grass vetiveria zizaniodes exist and since fresh as well as air dried roots of the grass are distilled that may vary with producer. therefore the vetiveryl acetate prepared from different vetiver oils may have a different composition. concentration ranges of various constituents of vetiveryl acetate should be provided. Ca. 100 constituents with a concentration of >0.01% are present in vetiveryl acetate, but identification of only 12 constituents (corresponding to 60% of the mixture) is described, leaving ca. 88

oil. no information is provided on the composition of various batches of vetiveryl acetate used in the submitted studies except that the ester content (varying from 46 to 99%) has been provided for some batches. it will not be possible to assess the toxicity profile of the constituents reported without chemical structure and cas no. of the constituents of vetiveryl acetate. information about the

content (varying from 46 to 99%) has been provided for some batches. no data was submitted concerning stability of vetiveryl acetate and its test solutions. subm. 3: the applicant agreed that the available cas numbers for substances derived from natural sources such as acetylated vetiver oil (avo) is highly confusing, and that registrations within the chemical abstract survey register relate to global differences in requirements for assigning specificity around uvcb regarding plant sections in certain regions of the world such as the usa. according to the applicant, in the eu, at least two cas numbers for acetylated vetiver oil (avo) exist: cas number 84082-84-8, vetiveria zizanioides, ext. acetylated, einecs nr 282-031-1. cas number 62563-80-8 vetiverol acetate, einecs nr 263-597-9 according to the applicant, the sccs remark on the ifra standard would be taken into consideration updating the upcoming 48th amendment, but stated that the global scope of ifra regulations for the fragrance industry necessitated the inclusion of cas numbers for acetylated vetiver oil (avo) from other regions of the world besides the eu. for the sake of relevance to this particular eu situation, however, the applicant would only refer to the eu cas number 84082-84-8 Vetiveria zizanioides ext. acetylated for this dossier. the applicant also agreed that the cas number 117-98-6 refers to a specific chemical (2,6-dimethyl-9-isopropylidenbicyclo(5.3.0)dec-2-en-4-yl-acetate ) and not to acetylated vetiver oil (avo) (as supported by the fragrance industry for this dossier) and would agree to remove this cas number from the dossier. according to the applicant, reference 13 in submission 2 referred to database information that the applicant can no longer access but it is superseded by the information presented in the response above. it was also noted by the sccs that the test substances used in different toxicological studies had been described in terms of more than one cas number. these included cas 84082-84-8, 68917-34-0, 62563-80-8 and 117-98-6. two of the cas numbers (62563-80-8 and 117-98-6) have been listed in CosIng as vetiveryl acetate/vetiverol acetate, with the iupac name of a specific substance (1,2,3,3a,4,5,6,8a-octahydro-2-isopropylidene-4,8-dimethylazulen-6-yl acetate). sccs noted that only cas number 62563-80-8 is correctly associated to 1,2,3,3a,4,5,6,8a-octahydro-2-isopropylidene-4,8-dimethylazulen-6-yl acetate) whereas cas number 117-98-6 identifies 2,6-dimethyl-9-isopropylidenbicyclo(5.3.0)dec-2-en-4-yl-acetate. the applicant explained that different cas numbers had been incorrectly used in the past to describe the same commercial fragrance material, i.e. acetylated vetiver oil (avo), for which a single cas 84082-84-8 is now proposed and used by the industry. the applicant also confirmed that all the tests presented in submission 2 dossier of 11 June 2013 (ref 1) had been conducted on acetylated vetiver oil (avo), and although some reports stated vetiveryl acetate (cas 117-98-6), the test article used in the studies was in fact what is now known as acetylated vetiver oil (avo) (cas 84082-84-8). based on the applicant's explanation, the sccs is willing to accept that the studies referring to cas 117-98-6 can be regarded as applicable to the acetylated vetiver oil (avo) (acetylated extract of vetiveria zizanoides, cas 84082-84-8) for the purpose of this assessment. however, the sccs is also aware of the limitations placed by the glp system on making any corrections/additions to a final report in the form of amendments which also need to be signed and dated by the Study Director. the sccs considers it to be the sole responsibility of the applicant to clarify/amend the cas number in the study reports through relevant institutions/authorities. the sccs also advises the applicant to get the relevant CosIng entries amended so that the material is question is correctly defined in terms of a single identifiable cas number. sccs comment on purity:  avo is the acetylated form of a natural fragrance (vetiver oil), which is composed of around 129 constituents. data presented by industry (13 may 2015) (ref 2) concerned the analysis of 18 samples of different avo batches produced by 10 manufacturers comparing analytical data from 2007 and 2015 shows that the range of variability of the constituents of acetylated vetiver, considered during an extended period of time, can be accepted for samples of natural origin. the sccs has considered this variation acceptable for a plant-derived

logKow for a complex multi-constituent substance such as acetylated vetiver oil (avo) is not meaningful, given the wide range of different structures and moieties. this could only result in a log Kow

dissolved in 10% ethanol and water. light Source - a white fluorescent lamp and near ultraviolet lamp. procedure - Samples were kept in transparent glass bottle of 50mL. protected samples wrapped in aluminium foil were used as controls. samples were exposed to light providing an overall illumination of no less than 1.2 million lux hours and an integrated near ultraviolet energy of no less than 200 w·h/m2 at 25°C then measured instantly in compliance with ICH guidelines, the analysis being repeated 3 times for each lot of product, using an HPLC assay with detection at 280 nm. the quantitation limit of HQ in the samples was 1 ppm. conclusion:no apparent change in the amount of β-arbutin was observed between light-exposed and control samples. a slight increase of hydroquinone, on the other hand, was observed in lightexposed 6.3% solutions although those levels were always below 2.5 ppm after light exposure. photostability at different pH values and temperatures (Test date 2008-9) sample type: 7% β-arbutin in phosphate buffers ranging from pH 2.0-11.0, samples prepared from Lot TTG-305 were subdivided and kept in transparent glass bottles (30ml). protected samples wrapped in aluminium foil were used as dark controls. samples were exposed to light (white fluorescent lamp) providing an overall illumination of no less than 1.2 million lux hours and an integrated near ultraviolet energy of no less than 200 w･h/m2 at 25ο (ICH guidelines). the effects of temperature were studied at 50°C for 1 month and 40°C for 3 months. the analyses were repeated 3 times for each lot of product. the authors concluded that for both the heat and light conditions, no apparent change on the amount of β-arbutin was observed at pH 4-11. β-arbutin levels were slightly decreased at pH ≤3 accompanied by a rapid increase of hydroquinone. the degree of hydroquinone generation was higher at low pH (~4,300ppm at 50°C 1 month and 3,700ppm at 40°C 3 months at pH 2); however only trace levels of hydroquinone were detected in neutral to basic solutions (pH 6-11). in a cosmetic formulation: accelerated test conditions for 6 months/ date of study: 2008-2009/method: Internal protocol Shiseido Co, Japan/test substance: Shiseido product C (Lot 0804A, B, C) containing 5.67-6.93% β-arbutin at pH 5.0-7.0/temperature: 40°C/relative humidity 75%/analytical method: HPLC/ samples were kept in a transparent glass bottle at 40°C and 75% relative humidity for 6 months. β-arbutin and hydroquinone concentrations were measured in threefold by HPLC for each batch at the start of the study, after 3 months and after 6 months. conclusions:  since the concentrations of β-arbutin were stable and those of hydroquinone remained below 1 ppm (detection limit), the study authors conclude that β-arbutin is stable in final cosmetic formulations and that no hydroquinone is released under accelerated ageing conditions for 6 months. ambient test conditions for 36 months, i.e.,long-term testing/date of study: 2003-6/method: internal protocol Shiseido Co, Japan/test substance: Shiseido product C (lot A, B, C) containing 5.67-6.93% β-arbutin (pH5.0-7.0)/temperature: 25°C/relative humidity: 60%/analytical method: HPLC/ samples of Shiseido product C were kept in a transparent glass bottle at ambient conditions for 3 years. β-arbutin and hydroquinone concentrations were measured in threefold by HPLC at the start and at the end of the study. since the concentrations of β-arbutin were stable and those of hydroquinone remained below 1 ppm (detection limit), the study authors conclude that β-arbutin is stable in the usual cosmetic formulation and that no hydroquinone is released under normal storage conditions for 3 years. overall conclusion:  β-arbutin is stable in final cosmetic formulations, hydroquinone content in the finished product was no more than 1 ppm (LLOQ) throughout the accelerated and longterm storage conditions (40°C, 75% relative humidity for 6 months and (25°C, 60% relative humidity for 36 months). β-arbutin was relatively stable to light when dissolved in a 10% ethanol aqueous solution. no significant change in the amount of β-arbutin was detected and only trace levels of hydroquinone (<0.25 ppm) were detected under the conditions of the ICH photostability test. β-arbutin was found to be unstable in low pH solutions, decrease of β-arbutin and significant increase of hydroquinone was observed, especially at pH 2. a recently published study(Yang CH et al. 2013) tested ß-arbutin (and deoxy-arbutin) at 10^-4 M (<0.003 % w/v) in aqueous solution with 10% propylene glycol and UV irradiation (narrow band UVB lightunit at 312 nm) at 2.65 mW/cm2: under these conditions (pH not given), ß-arbutin wasreduced to 43.5% of the initial level after 2 h of irradiation, and hydroquinone was detectedat significant levels (up to 20%) over the test period (up to 12 h). SCCS comment: as the test concentration is far below that used in cosmetic products, this study, Yang CH et al. is considered to be of limited relevance. the results presented in the respective studies regarding photostability testing (according to ICH guideline) and pH- or temperature-dependent stabilities of β-arbutin sound conclusive and reliable. In cosmetic formulations hydroquinone as impurity remained below 1 ppm (detection limit). yet, aside from reduced photostability under certain UV irradiation conditions (Yang et al. 2013), it is to be considered that β-arbutin may also undergo cutaneous hydrolysis into hydroquinone due to enzymatic activity through β-glucosidases in skin (Mier & van den Hurk 1976; Redoules et al. 2005) or via the activity of microbes residing on the surface of the skin (Bang et al. 2008). ","the naturally occurring compound β-arbutin (4-hydroxyphenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, hydroquinone-β-glucopyranoside, CAS 497-76-7) is a β-D-glucopyranoside derivative of hydroquinone that can be found in the leaves and bark of many plants. it has been proposed for use as a skin-lightening agent, inhibiting production of the skin pigment melanin which is formed through a series of oxidative reactions involving the amino acid tyrosine and the enzyme tyrosinase. this enzyme catalyses the hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-DOPA (dihydroxyphenylalanine) and the oxidation of DOPA to dopaquinone which is then further metabolised to melanin. β-Arbutin is thought to act by inhibition of the activity of melanosomal tyrosinase, where the inhibition may be due to structural similarities to the substrate tyrosine (Zhu and Gao, 2008). β-arbutin can be hydrolysed both in acid solution and by enzymic action to hydroquinone which also acts as a skin lightening agent, again by inhibiting tyrosinase. Extended use of ≥2% hydroquinone, topically applied, has been associated with adverse effects including exogenous ochronosis in dark-skinned people. hydroquinone, like β-arbutin, is present in many dietary components in trace amounts and is metabolised in vivo to its glucuronide and sulphate conjugates. β-arbutin is proposed to be used as a skin-lightening agent in cosmetic face creams or face lotions at concentrations up to 7%.",,

SCCS comments: percentage content of all of the impurities should be calculated at λmax = 246 nm of the test substance. quantitative determination of R0011102A (p-phenylenediamine) content by HPLC was carried out at 240 nm. to prove that the filtration does not interfere with the analysis of the test substance and impurities, a chromatogram obtained from the analysis of the sample before the filtration should be compared (“% area and retention times” of A166 and impurities, number of impurities) to a chromatogram obtained from the analysis of the same sample after filtration and under the same chromatographic conditions. during commenting period, in appendix 1, the applicant has two assays conducted before and after the filtration of the sample, under the same chromatographic conditions showing that the % area of the main product and impurities are comparable in these two assays. SCCS underlines that applicant should have clearly indicated which of the two assays have been conducted before or after filtration. considering MoS calculation based on added information provided by applicant during the public consultation period (i.e. NOAEL value of 200 mg/kg/day (NOAEL obtained in the 28- day oral toxicity study in rats – OECD 407 (1999)), SCCS agrees on the fact that the presence of the impurity 3-aminopropyl imidazole at a maximum level of 0.1% in methylimidazoliumpropyl p-phenylenediamine, Cl, 2HCl (A166) presents no or a negligible risk to human health. considering complementary information provided by applicant during the public consultation period, the exposure to the impurity chloroethane to be considered is equal to 100 microgram per day which is below the NSRL of 150 microgram/day. in addition, such an exposure of 100 microgram / day is far below the virtual safe dose (996 microgram/day) calculated based on the LTD10 with a MoE of 10000. SCCS agrees that the presence of the impurity chloroethane at a maximum level of 0.05% in methylimidazoliumpropyl pphenylenediamine, Cl, 2HCl (A166) is unlikely to present a risk to human health. one of the impurities, 4-aminophenylamine dihydrochloride (synonym p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride), has already been the subject of an SCCS opinion (SCCS/1443/11 revision of 18 september 2012), which raised concerns over its strong skin sensitising potency. the solubility was measured in water only. this study was conducted in compliance with: - OECD guideline for the testing of chemicals: N° 105 - water solubility adopted July 27, 1995. - OECD principles of good laboratory practice. test material batch R0027494A 008 L 002 (99.9% pure) was used in this study. a preliminary test for the water solubility was carried out. the water solubility of the test item was estimated to be greater than 1 kg/L in pure water at room temperature (20°C ± 5°C). at this high level of solubility, no pH-dependency could be observed. based on the guideline the shake flask method was used for the test performance for substances with solubility > 10 mg/L. test principle shake flask method the closed vessels containing (5 g test item, 1 ml solvent) were incubated in a shaking water bath at 30 °C for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively. soon after the start of the preincubation time, the samples appeared as deep dark brown solution with colourless crystals of 2-5 mm size inside. at the end of each incubation period the vessels were removed from the water bath and equilibrated for another 24 hours at 20 °C under shaking. the remaining test item was separated by filtration through a 0.45 μm syringe tip filter and analysed by HPLC / UV. the results showed no tendency to change over time and met all validity criteria, therefore the study is considered to be valid. based on the analyses, the solubility of the test item in water was determined to be 931 g/L at 20 °C. the determination of the concentration in the saturated solutions was done under usage of a quadratic regression. the arrangements made to prevent a possible oxidation of the test item (overlay with argon, addition of ascorbic acid in the solvent) seem to be sufficient. ref : Wöhr T.

IV). nearly all physicochemical information originates from submission IV. the documentation of
these data in this submission is inadequate. many of the data cannot be linked to certain batches. this leads to many shortcomings: - only one batch (919151) was fully characterized for identity and impurities - all other batches were not sufficiently characterized - for all batches, the data on purity are insufficient - data on the stability and homogeneity of o-aminophenol or its formulations have not been supplied. conclusion: on the basis of the data provided no conclusions can be drawn neither with respect to the purity of o-aminophenol batches nor to the homogeneity or stability of o-aminophenol or its formulations. possible impurities that may originate from reagents and intermediate products of synthesis have been reported to be below limit of detection. this might be a hint that the state of the art syntheses of o-aminophenol lead to products with purities of about 99% or even better. in this case differing purities of o-aminophenol batches would have no influence on the toxicological evaluation. however, since descriptions of the synthesis are missing, this assumption cannot be ascertained.

","Boric acid is a weak acid with a pKa of 9.2 and exists primarily as the undissociated acid (H3BO3) in aqueous solution at physiological pH, as do the borate salts. Therefore, the toxicity associated with the boron compounds listed in Annex II to this mandate is expected to be similar based on boron equivalents. Boron oxide will produce similar effects because it is an anhydride that reacts exothermically with water in the body to form boric acid. In aqueous solutions of sodium perborate at room temperature an equilibrium between sodium perborate and hydrogen peroxide/sodium metaborate is instantly established. Sodium metaborate is the salt of a strong base (sodium hydroxide) and a weak acid (boric acid). Therefore, it is expected to be present in aqueous solutions at environmental temperature and ph mainly as the weakly dissociated boric acid. Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate is a solid solution of boric acid and disodium tetraborate decahydrate. Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate is converted into boric acid//borate upon dissolution in water (EU, 2009b). Annex III entry 1a of the Cosmetic Directive 76/768/EEC concerns boric acid, borates, and tetraborates (with the exception of N,N-Dimethylanilinium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate [EINECS No. 422-050-6, CAS No. 118612-00-3] listed as entry no 1184 in annex ii of 76/768/EEC; as used in a) Talc, b) Products for oral hygiene, c) Other products (excluding bath products and hair waving products). Annex III entry 1b concerns tetraborates as used in a) Bath products, b) Hair waving products. SCCS consider that substances listed in Annex II of this mandate that have chemical, biological and toxicological properties similar to “boric acid, borates and tetraborates”, and are not covered by other specific regulations in the Cosmetic Directive, are covered by Annex III entry 1a. (and 1b for tetraborates). Consequently, the SCCS is of the opinion that the following substances listed in Annex II to this mandate are covered by the Annex III entry 1a of the cosmetics directive (table 1 of the opinion). Tetraborates are also covered by Annex III 1b. Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate is a solid solution of boric acid and disodium tetraborate decahydrate. Octaborates have not been classified as toxic to reproduction and no specific concentration limits are assigned to them. However, based on its composition, Disodium octaborate tetrahydrate is expected to have similar toxicological properties on a boron equivalents basis as the compounds listed in table 1. Therefore it is considered to be covered by entries III 1 a and 1b. The toxicological properties of perborates/perboric acid are discussed in a separate opinion (SCCS/1345/10). According to the considerations laid out in this opinion, these substances are also covered by entry III/12 of the Cosmetics Directive. The SCCS considers that the following substance listed in annex II to this mandate is not covered by the entries Annex III 1a and 1b of the Cosmetics Directive (Table 2 in the opinion), since it is an organic metal compound. No specific concentration limit has been established for its classification as reprotoxic, cat. 2. It is also classified as a mutagen (Cat. 3).

 at 25°C (ref7) ",3.87 cst (ref 7) ,,,,,,,,,,"D5 is commonly used as volatile excipient in cosmetic products. it is largely used in many cosmetic products due to: low surface tension which allows it to spread rapidly on skin and hair, its hydrophobicity, its volatility (D5 evaporates from skin or hair within 4-12 hours after application) and its stability (low reactivity in acidic or aqueous products). due to these properties, d5 can have many different functions in cosmetic products including antistatic, emollient, humectant, solvent, viscosity controlling and hair conditioning. an extensive survey of cosmetics europe’s members was conducted in 2013 to better know the use of D5. in total, 38 companies, including the largest personal care products companies operating in Europe contributed to the survey. whilst these data only provide a partial sample in terms of the total use of D5 in cosmetics, it is believed that the majority of use categories in the EU are captured by these data. results from this survey indicate that D5 is widely used in cosmetic products by both international companies and small and medium enterprises. the data received spanned a wide range of product categories and a very broad concentration range. the main use of D5 in cosmetic products is in skin care products, deodorants/antiperspirants, hair care products and make up products.","sccs comment on log Pow: log Pow was not determined by the eu method a.8.henry’s law constant: 185 at 23°C (ref8), surface tension: 18.5 dyne/cm at 25°C (ref1). conversion factor: 1 ppm = 15.1 mg/m3; 1 mg/m3 = 0.0645 ppm. general comments to physico-chemical characterisation: d5 may contain traces of d4 which is classified in the eu as toxic to reproduction (repr 2 h361f according to annex VI of regulation (ec) no 1272/2008 (clp-regulation)). therefore, the level of impurity of d4 should be kept as low as possible.

CPC has been demonstrated to be stable under normal storage conditions. it is known that quaternary ammonium compounds degrade at elevated temperatures by a hoffman elimination. in the case of CPC, this degradation will form hexadecane and pyridine-hcl. the temperature for this degradation to occur is about 130 °C. The stability of CPC monohydrate has been demonstrated through a stability testing programme. The supplier tested for the presence of hexadecane and Cetyl chloride in CPC samples over a 5- year period. Hexadecane and Cetylchloride were < 0.05% in the stability samples over this time. The stability of CPC (D1470.01) was determined at concentrations of 2 and 50 mg/ml (ref.: 4) and of 5 mg/ml (ref.: 6). the results showed that the formulations were stable for 10 days at room temperature.

Overall SCCS comment to physico-chemical characterisation: the impurities in commercial cetylpyridinium chloride have not been described. the applicant has declared that “no impurities of toxicological or ecotoxicological concern or impurities which exceed 1 g/kg are present in technical grade CPC.” however, qualitative and quantitative impurities, which may be present at <1 g/kg level, have not been reported. Submission I for cetylpyridinium chloride was submitted in march 2005. The SCCP concluded (SCCP/0985/06) that in view of the poor quality of the toxicological data presented in the submitted dossier a new dossier should be submitted with data on all relevant toxicological end-points and conforming to currently accepted standards. Submission II for cetylpyridinium chloride was submitted in July 2011. Submission II is almost identical to submission I, i.e. submission II consists mainly of the same references as submission I with many of the pdf files being of poor quality (including incomplete pages, handwritten notes) that makes reading very difficult. Submission II is supplemented with a separate submission by a company (called Company Submission in this opinion) in 2011 to the European Chemicals Agency (echa) for use as a biocide. In contrast to submission II (and submission I) the company submission includes studies on acute oral, dermal and inhalation toxicity, skin and eye irritation, and skin sensitisation, which have been performed according to currently accepted test guidelines. Two genotoxicity studies (in vitro mouse lymphoma test and in vitro chromosome aberration test) performed according to currently accepted test guidelines are included in submission II (and submission I). The company submission also includes an in vivo micronucleus study. The studies in the company submission on repeated dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and on adme are identical to those in submission II (and submission I). No studies have been included in the company submission regarding carcinogenicity and dermal absorption, but a justification for non-submission of data has been provided.

More specifically, the application of a DHA-containing selftanning formulation to the skin produces a reaction between DHA and skin contents. DHA reacts with the amino acids and amino groups of proteins present in sweat, keratin and skin, eventually leading to the production of coloured melanoidins. The applicant explains that there is much evidence to suggest that the process is similar to the ""maillard reaction"", also known as non-enzymatic browning. 2 - 6 hours after application, a brown coloration appears that has a similar hue to that of natural sun tan. as the DHA molecules are bound to free amino acids and proteins of the skin, the colour obtained is substantive and cannot easily be washed off. It only fades in the course of mechanical abrasion or natural exfoliation of the skin. DHA has been used worldwide in cosmetic products, i.e. skin care products for face and body, instant tan formulations and 'flash bronzers' in combination with colorants. The applicant (Colipa, representing 8 cosmetic companies) wishes to support the use of DHA in face creams and body lotions at a concentration of up to 10%. The recommended use levels depend on the skin type and tanning status of the user: Ca. 3 - 5 % in formulations for persons with light skin (skin type I - II), Ca. 5 - 10 % in formulations for persons with dark skin (skin type III - IV / V), Ca. 1 - 2 % in formulations for skin care products (creams and lotions). the use of DHA solutions in spray cabins, however, is not supported by Colipa, as none of its member companies manufacture products used in spray cabins. ref.: 1. a report of the danish toxicology centre (DTC) summarizes the major spraying systems used to treat customers with DHA self-tanning creams (containing 8-14% of dha): 1) the manual turbine spray or spraying ‘pistol’, spraying a high air volume under low pressure onto the skin. The formulation is sprayed from about 15 cm distance from the customer’s body. 2) the third-generation spray booth, consisting of a closed compartment in which, after a short countdown, 3 rows of nozzles spray lotion on the entire body. turning around is not necessary, as the whole body is treated in one spray action. once the spraying stops, the customer immediately leaves the spraying compartment, in which a thick aerosol mist has meanwhile been formed. 3) the fourth-generation spray booth, i.e. an open booth, in which the formulation is charged to 40,000 V and sprayed through 2 vertical rows of nozzles. the customer stands on two earthed metal plates so that the lotion hits her/his body very accurately through electrostatic energy. after 2-3 seconds, the customer turns around and the other side of the body is treated. in addition, the DTC document reports on some important exposure parameters related to each of the spraying systems, and on the DHA levels measured in the air around the mouth/nose during treatment in a number of operational booths. parameter: amount of formulation used, manual turbine spray: ± 25 ml, third-generation (closed) spray booth: ± 60 ml, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: ± 15 ml; parameter: application time, manual turbine spray: 2-3 minutes, third-generation (closed) spray booth: 6 seconds, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: 4-6 seconds; parameter: estimated inhalation exposure, manual turbine spray: aerosol cloud is minimal, thus minimal inhalation exposure, third-generation (closed) spray booth: a thick aerosol mist is present in the spraying compartment, thus inhalation is likely. fourth-generation (open) spray booth: aerosol drops are 10 x smaller than in third generation booths; nevertheless, inhalation is expected to be low due to ‘electrostatic precision’; parameter: protective measures to be taken, manual turbine spray: no specific measures, third-generation (closed) spray booth: customer is advised to keep eyes and mouth shut during treatment, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: customer is advised to use nose filters and eye protection; parameter: measured DHA concentration (droplets < 12µm), manual turbine spray: 0.8 mg/m³ air, third-generation (closed) spray booth: up to 238 mg/m³ air, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: up to 17 mg/m³ air; parameter: calculated exposure level per treatment (general inhalation rate of 1.5 m³/hour is assumed for adult man (low activity) [technical guidance document on risk assessment, part I, European commission, ecb, 2003].), manual turbine spray: (0.05h x 1.5m³/hour x 0.8 mg/m³) = 0.06 mg dha, third-generation (closed) spray booth: (0.0017h x 1.5m³/hour x 238 mg/m³) = 0.61 mg dha, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: (0.0017h x 1.5m³/hour x 17 mg/m³) = 0.04 mg dha. ref.: 12.",Surface tension: 0.0689 N/m (20°C) (dihydroxyacetone batch number VP983050 ec a.5 (oecd 115)); Flammability (solids): not a highly flammable solid (Dihydroxyacetone batch number VP983050 ec a.10).,

CI 45430 (Erythrosine) is listed in Annex IV of the EU Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC which permits its use as a colorant in cosmetic products, without a concentration limit for this use. It is, however, not permitted as a hair dye ingredient because a safety dossier supporting its use was not provided under the European Hair Dye strategy(1) and thesubstance was subsequently banned for this use2 (Annex II, entry 1337). Erythrosine is historically reported as being used in a range of cosmetic applications including toothpaste, lipstick, eye products, face decorative products, bath & shower products, hair products including sprays & conditioners, shampoos, deodorants, fragrance products, and soap (COLIPA 2006). Following calls for toxicological data on this colour, only the use of this colour in toothpaste products has been actively defended. For this reason this dossier only supports the use of erythrosine in toothpaste products up to a level of 0.0025% and does not relate to its safety in all cosmetic applications. As a food colorant, erythrosine is added to a range of products to include sweets (Turkish delight), biscuits, glace and tinned cherries and sausages. Following a review of the available scientific data, The European Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) has allocated an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0 to 0.1 mg/kg body weight (SCF, 1987). In 1990, the same ADI was assigned by the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee for Food Additives (JECFA, 1990), following a re-evaluation of the safety of this colorant. In the EU, Erythrosine is permitted as a colorant in foodstuff3 . It is limited for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries up to a maximum level of 200 mg/kg and in Bigarreaux cherries in syrup and cocktails up to 150 mg/kg. Erythrosine is also approved for use in EU pharmaceutical preparations as a colorant in both solid (capsules/tablets/sugar-coated pills) and liquid (drops/syrups) pharmaceutical preparations. In 1988, The Scientific Committee on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (SCMPMD) issued a favourable opinion on the use of erythrosine in pharmaceutical products. Erythrosine is typically present at levels of 0.0017 to 0.96 mg/capsule or tablet respectively and at levels of 0.009 to 0.8 mg/mL for oral liquid preparations. In the US, FD&C Red 3 is permanently listed for use in foods and ingested drugs. In 1990, erythrosine was de-listed by FDA for use in cosmetics and externally applied drugs, following the initial suggested findings that this colorant may induce carcinogenicity in rats. The FDA adopted the Delaney clause which restricts the use of any ingredient, regardless of the amount used, if an ingredient is shown to induce cancer in animals or humans. The FDA did not have an immediate safety concern with this colorant and identified the potential risk based on the data available as about 1 in 100, 000 over a 70 year lifetime. This colorant remains approved for use in the U.S. in foods and ingested drugs. 1: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/hair-dye-products/safety-strategy/index_en.htm",,

EcoG+,https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/consumer_safety/docs/sccs_o_198.pdf,"EcoG+ is a composite material consisting of three components, i.e. (1) silver-containing phosphate glass powder, (2) glass beads and (3) an appropriate polymer (for example polypropylene, PP), as detailed in Table 1, below. The inclusion of glass beads is not required for the antimicrobial activity of EcoG+ and it is envisaged that some packaging may contain components (1) and (3) only.

The level of silver ion achieved in the EcoG+ packaging is therefore 420-600 ppm. As described above, EcoG+ contains three components; i.e. silver-containing phosphate glass powder, glass beads and an appropriate polymer. EcoG+ therefore acts as a carrier for the active component, the silver ion, which is intended to be released in small amounts into the cosmetic product contained within the EcoG+ packaging. The species ultimately released into the cosmetic product is the silver ion; the silver released into the cosmetic product is not in the form of colloidal silver or nanosilver. Additionally, although silver nitrate is used as the source of silver, it is important to note that the silver ion is released into the cosmetic product without the nitrate counterion. This is because any nitrate present is destroyed by the very high temperatures used in the manufacture of EcoG+ glass and is liberated during the manufacturing process as nitrogen gas.",phosphate glass / Silver ion,phosphate glass containing 1.4 to 2 % Ag / silver ,EcoG+,,7440-22-4 (silver),231-131-3 (silver),,,,,Ag+,"subm II: 1/6 Ag2O･(P2O5･ZnO)m･(9CaO･2Al2O3･B2O3･Na2O)n m=10, n=0.2～0.4 (silver glass powder)","EcoG+ is a solid composite material containing silver glass white powder (million guard PG721st), glass beads and a suitable polymer. the silver ions present in the silver glass powder (million guard PG721st) will disperse throughout the structure of EcoG+.

The achieved level of the active component (i.e. the silver ion) in EcoG+ packaging is 420-600 ppm. During the proposed use of the composite material as cosmetic product packaging, small amounts of silver ions are released into the cosmetic product, where a preservative function is intended. EcoG+ packaging may be used with a variety of cosmetic product types.

The purities described are based on measurements performed by potentiometric titration of amine function. Thus, the reported purities also include amounts of impurities C, D, E, X and Y, which have amine functional groups. In addition, any salt content in HC Blue n° 14 will not be measured by the potentiometric titration performed. The SCCS considers that potentiometric titration for the measurement of the purity and the impurity is not the state of the art. - HC Blue n° 14 is a secondary alkanolamine and thus it is prone to nitrosation. No information is provided on the nitrosamine content of the test material. - Stability of HC Blue n° 14 in typical hair dye formulations is not reported",
