GC-MS quantitation of the impurities should also be provided based on the GC-MS data presented in the report. hydroquinone content should be accurately quantified in each batch and be at unavoidable trace level in each batch. stability of 1,2,4-THB in solution depends on the amount of dissolved oxygen in the solution. if the solution has been thoroughly degassed and is stored in an inert atmosphere or in a sealed container, the material will be stable until oxygen exposure is allowed. once oxygen is available, the molecule will undergo oxidation and condense with itself to form dimers and oligomers in the absence of primary intermediates. Black particulate matter of high molecular weight precipitates out of the solution and settles to the bottom. in view of the reactivity of 1,2,4-THB with oxygen, these hair dye formulations are filled into specialised, oxygen-barrier packaging for commercialisation. stability tests are conducted under standard conditions (both room and elevated temperature) appropriate for cosmetic products. final product stability meets standard requirements until the package is opened by the consumer for use. upon dispensing and application, the combination of dyes (including 1,2,4-THB and precursors) in the formulation undergo oxidative reactions as is predicted by their chemical structure. stability of 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene in typical hair dye formulations was not reported except the reaction of 1,2,4-THB in the presence of the primary intermediate PTD (A5), which was studied as a representative example of oxidative coupling with primary intermediates in general. in response to the request for clarification from the SCCS on uses of 1,2,4-THB, the applicant confirmed that 1,2,4-THB is intended to be used in the presence of primary intermediates such as p-phenylenediamine (A7), p-toluenediamine (PTD)(A5), N,N bis–(2-hydroxyethyl) pphenylenediamine (A50) and p-aminophenol (A16), just to name a few. this is done to achieve a range of desired permanent colours, and the particular primary intermediate or combination thereof will depend on the desired shade. it was also confirmed that the only study conducted in the presence of a primary intermediate was the dermal absorption work, which evaluated dermal absorption with the 1,2,4-THB in a simple formulation with PTD (A5).  All other studies submitted for the safety evaluation of 1,2,4-THB were conducted with 1,2,4THB alone.",

properties. however, in Europe and the USA, retinyl palmitate is not allowed to be added as UV-filter as such (VKM, 2012). several studies have demonstrated that topical retinol may induce the same cellular and molecular changes as retinoic acid although a 20 times higher dose is needed and the local irritation characteristics are less prominent. it has been shown that retinol could be effective in the treatment of skin aging and photoaging, but the effect was dependent on the vehicle used, as retinol is unstable and easily gets degraded to biologically inactive forms when
exposed to light and air (VKM, 2012). in several studies it has been demonstrated that retinal may be a useful topical agent in the treatment of aged and photoaged skin. various cosmetic products containing retinal, primarily anti-aging preparations, are available on the European market. based on information provided by cosmetic industry, vitamin A and esters are not used for children in the EU.  ","vitamin A is used as a cosmetic ingredient at maximum use concentrations of 0.05%(retinol equivalents) in body lotions, 0.3% (retinol equivalents) in hand and face creams as well as in other leave on or rinse-off products. these products are usually presented as anti -wrinkle products. retinoic acid is banned in cosmetic products in the EU whatever the concentration (Annex 2,entry 375). analytics: recently, a novel sensitive analytical method was reported, including reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet (UV) detection for the quantification of retinol, retinyl palmitate, and retinoic acid in cosmetic preparations with respective recoveries from spiked cosmetic products of 95% or higher (Hubinger JC (2009) Determination of retinol, retinyl palmitate and retinoic acid in consumer cosmetic products, J. Cosmet. Sci., 60, 485-500) . the author emphasised that the method may be used to quantitatively determine several retinoids and their isomers in cosmetic products but it is unclear if the HPLC method has been applied to the analysis of the batches used in toxicity testing. this method does not include retinyl acetate, retinyl linoleate or retinal. calculations use international units (IUs) or retinol equivalents (REs). a conversion of the individual derivatives into IUs can be found as follow: 1IU of vitamin A corresponds to vitamin A derivative 1IU corresponds to 0.300 μg of retinol, to 0.345 μg retinyl acetate, to 0.359 μg retinyl propionate, and to 0.550 μg of retinyl palmitate",

3.75, 4.098, 4.812, 117; 250, 284, 288, 101. stability of the test solutions was not assessed in any of the other studies where a solvent was used. however, based on the functional groups identified in avo, the nature of the solvents used and the short time period between preparation and use of the solutions it is expected that they would be stable. the shelf life of avo claimed by manufacturers varies between one and two years when stored in full, sealed containers. typically, product shelf-life is determined after a series of analytical investigations over the time period claimed. samples are checked regularly following the same initial control plan used for reception/manufacture. the main investigations concern the physico-chemical and organoleptic measurements
(specific gravity, refractive index, colour, odour) and gc comparison. as an example, gc profiles from the same batch of avo (sample 1; not stabilised with antioxidant) measured at 0 and 14 months (a 12 month shelf-life is claimed) showed no significant change over this time period.","subm. 2:fragrance in perfumes and in cosmetics with following limits: category 1 (lip products) 0.07%,category 2 (deodorants/antiperspirants) 0.08%, category 3(hydro-alcoholic products for shaved skin) 0.35%, category 4 (hydro-alcoholic products for unshaved skin) 1.04%, category 5 (women facial cream, facial make up, hand cream) 0.55%, category 6 (mouthwash, toothpaste) 1.67%, category 8 (make up remover, nail care) 2.00%, category 9 (shampoo, rinse-off conditioner, bar soap) 5.00%. subm. 3: acetylated vetiver oil (avo), as used, is a mixture of many constituents, resulting from acetylation of crude vetiver oil. avo is used as a fragrance in perfumes and in cosmetics. maximum use concentration of avo in various types of cosmetic products is described in the following table below (provided by the applicant). according to the applicant, these are the maximum concentrations they would like to defend in different cosmetic product categories. they have incorporated the product category of hydroalcoholic based fragrances/perfumes, which is of critical importance for them but not yet part of the systemic exposure calculation table as contained in the sccs notes of guidance (2016) to derive the margin of safety. product type: % acetylated vetiver oil (avo) in consumer product; hydroalcoholic-based fragrances (e.g. eau de toilette, perfume, aftershave, cologne): 0.90; deodorants: 0.05; make up products (e.g. eye make-up, make-up remover, liquid foundation, mascara, eyeliner, lipstick): 0.05; face cream: 0.10; hand cream: 0.10; body lotion: 0.10; hair styling: 0.10; bath cleansing products (e.g. soaps, shower gel, rinse-off conditioner, shampoo): 0.20","subm. 2: since the compound is a mixture, solubility and  molecular weight are not applicable. vetiver oils of different origin (India, Indonesia, Haiti, Brazil etc) may have a different composition. the quality of commercial vetiver oils may differ considerably since several varieties of the grass vetiveria zizaniodes exist and since fresh as well as air dried roots of the grass are distilled that may vary with producer. therefore the vetiveryl acetate prepared from different vetiver oils may have a different composition. concentration ranges of various constituents of vetiveryl acetate should be provided. Ca. 100 constituents with a concentration of >0.01% are present in vetiveryl acetate, but identification of only 12 constituents (corresponding to 60% of the mixture) is described, leaving ca. 88 constituents unknown. thus, more than 40% of the vetiveryl acetate is composed of the unknown ca. 88 constituents. no documentation was provided for characterisation and quantification of the substances present in vetiveryl acetate. by polar/apolar GC, the GC peaks cannot be characterised as acetate, ketone or sesqiterpene. the method of determining acetate, ketone or sesqiterpene in vetiveryl acetate is not described. composition of vetiveryl acetate prepared by acetylation of alcohols of vetiver oil (vetiverol) will be different from that prepared by acetylation of whole vetiver oil. no information is provided on the composition of various batches of vetiveryl acetate used in the submitted studies except that the ester content (varying from 46 to 99%) has been provided for some batches. it will not be possible to assess the toxicity profile of the constituents reported without chemical structure and cas no. of the constituents of vetiveryl acetate. information about the

depending upon the origin of vetiver oil/vetiverol and the method of acetylation. the composition of the batches of vetiveryl acetate used in various studies is not provided except that the ester content (varying from 46 to 99%) has been provided for some batches. no data was submitted concerning stability of vetiveryl acetate and its test solutions. subm. 3: the applicant agreed that the available cas numbers for substances derived from natural sources such as acetylated vetiver oil (avo) is highly confusing, and that registrations within the chemical abstract survey register relate to global differences in requirements for assigning specificity around uvcb regarding plant sections in certain regions of the world such as the usa. according to the applicant, in the eu, at least two cas numbers for acetylated vetiver oil (avo) exist: cas number 84082-84-8, vetiveria zizanioides, ext. acetylated, einecs nr 282-031-1. cas number 62563-80-8 vetiverol acetate, einecs nr 263-597-9 according to the applicant, the sccs remark on the ifra standard would be taken into consideration updating the upcoming 48th amendment, but stated that the global scope of ifra regulations for the fragrance industry necessitated the inclusion of cas numbers for acetylated vetiver oil (avo) from other regions of the world besides the eu. for the sake of relevance to this particular eu situation, however, the applicant would only refer to the eu cas number 84082-84-8 Vetiveria zizanioides ext. acetylated for this dossier. the applicant also agreed that the cas number 117-98-6 refers to a specific chemical (2,6-dimethyl-9-isopropylidenbicyclo(5.3.0)dec-2-en-4-yl-acetate ) and not to acetylated vetiver oil (avo) (as supported by the fragrance industry for this dossier) and would agree to remove this cas number from the dossier. according to the applicant, reference 13 in submission 2 referred to database information that the applicant can no longer access but it is superseded by the information presented in the response above. it was also noted by the sccs that the test substances used in different toxicological studies had been described in terms of more than one cas number. these included cas 84082-84-8, 68917-34-0, 62563-80-8 and 117-98-6. two of the cas numbers (62563-80-8 and 117-98-6) have been listed in CosIng as vetiveryl acetate/vetiverol acetate, with the iupac name of a specific substance (1,2,3,3a,4,5,6,8a-octahydro-2-isopropylidene-4,8-dimethylazulen-6-yl acetate). sccs noted that only cas number 62563-80-8 is correctly associated to 1,2,3,3a,4,5,6,8a-octahydro-2-isopropylidene-4,8-dimethylazulen-6-yl acetate) whereas cas number 117-98-6 identifies 2,6-dimethyl-9-isopropylidenbicyclo(5.3.0)dec-2-en-4-yl-acetate. the applicant explained that different cas numbers had been incorrectly used in the past to describe the same commercial fragrance material, i.e. acetylated vetiver oil (avo), for which a single cas 84082-84-8 is now proposed and used by the industry. the applicant also confirmed that all the tests presented in submission 2 dossier of 11 June 2013 (ref 1) had been conducted on acetylated vetiver oil (avo), and although some reports stated vetiveryl acetate (cas 117-98-6), the test article used in the studies was in fact what is now known as acetylated vetiver oil (avo) (cas 84082-84-8). based on the applicant's explanation, the sccs is willing to accept that the studies referring to cas 117-98-6 can be regarded as applicable to the acetylated vetiver oil (avo) (acetylated extract of vetiveria zizanoides, cas 84082-84-8) for the purpose of this assessment. however, the sccs is also aware of the limitations placed by the glp system on making any corrections/additions to a final report in the form of amendments which also need to be signed and dated by the Study Director. the sccs considers it to be the sole responsibility of the applicant to clarify/amend the cas number in the study reports through relevant institutions/authorities. the sccs also advises the applicant to get the relevant CosIng entries amended so that the material is question is correctly defined in terms of a single identifiable cas number. sccs comment on purity:  avo is the acetylated form of a natural fragrance (vetiver oil), which is composed of around 129 constituents. data presented by industry (13 may 2015) (ref 2) concerned the analysis of 18 samples of different avo batches produced by 10 manufacturers comparing analytical data from 2007 and 2015 shows that the range of variability of the constituents of acetylated vetiver, considered during an extended period of time, can be accepted for samples of natural origin. the sccs has considered this variation acceptable for a plant-derived

logKow for a complex multi-constituent substance such as acetylated vetiver oil (avo) is not meaningful, given the wide range of different structures and moieties. this could only result in a log Kow spanning several digits. logP values have been provided. however, the sccs notes that chemical characterisation of the compounds that correspond to these seventeen logP values has not been provided.

dissolved in 10% ethanol and water. light Source - a white fluorescent lamp and near ultraviolet lamp. procedure - Samples were kept in transparent glass bottle of 50mL. protected samples wrapped in aluminium foil were used as controls. samples were exposed to light providing an overall illumination of no less than 1.2 million lux hours and an integrated near ultraviolet energy of no less than 200 w·h/m2 at 25°C then measured instantly in compliance with ICH guidelines, the analysis being repeated 3 times for each lot of product, using an HPLC assay with detection at 280 nm. the quantitation limit of HQ in the samples was 1 ppm. conclusion:no apparent change in the amount of β-arbutin was observed between light-exposed and control samples. a slight increase of hydroquinone, on the other hand, was observed in lightexposed 6.3% solutions although those levels were always below 2.5 ppm after light exposure. photostability at different pH values and temperatures (Test date 2008-9) sample type: 7% β-arbutin in phosphate buffers ranging from pH 2.0-11.0, samples prepared from Lot TTG-305 were subdivided and kept in transparent glass bottles (30ml). protected samples wrapped in aluminium foil were used as dark controls. samples were exposed to light (white fluorescent lamp) providing an overall illumination of no less than 1.2 million lux hours and an integrated near ultraviolet energy of no less than 200 w･h/m2 at 25ο (ICH guidelines). the effects of temperature were studied at 50°C for 1 month and 40°C for 3 months. the analyses were repeated 3 times for each lot of product. the authors concluded that for both the heat and light conditions, no apparent change on the amount of β-arbutin was observed at pH 4-11. β-arbutin levels were slightly decreased at pH ≤3 accompanied by a rapid increase of hydroquinone. the degree of hydroquinone generation was higher at low pH (~4,300ppm at 50°C 1 month and 3,700ppm at 40°C 3 months at pH 2); however only trace levels of hydroquinone were detected in neutral to basic solutions (pH 6-11). in a cosmetic formulation: accelerated test conditions for 6 months/ date of study: 2008-2009/method: Internal protocol Shiseido Co, Japan/test substance: Shiseido product C (Lot 0804A, B, C) containing 5.67-6.93% β-arbutin at pH 5.0-7.0/temperature: 40°C/relative humidity 75%/analytical method: HPLC/ samples were kept in a transparent glass bottle at 40°C and 75% relative humidity for 6 months. β-arbutin and hydroquinone concentrations were measured in threefold by HPLC for each batch at the start of the study, after 3 months and after 6 months. conclusions:  since the concentrations of β-arbutin were stable and those of hydroquinone remained below 1 ppm (detection limit), the study authors conclude that β-arbutin is stable in final cosmetic formulations and that no hydroquinone is released under accelerated ageing conditions for 6 months. ambient test conditions for 36 months, i.e.,long-term testing/date of study: 2003-6/method: internal protocol Shiseido Co, Japan/test substance: Shiseido product C (lot A, B, C) containing 5.67-6.93% β-arbutin (pH5.0-7.0)/temperature: 25°C/relative humidity: 60%/analytical method: HPLC/ samples of Shiseido product C were kept in a transparent glass bottle at ambient conditions for 3 years. β-arbutin and hydroquinone concentrations were measured in threefold by HPLC at the start and at the end of the study. since the concentrations of β-arbutin were stable and those of hydroquinone remained below 1 ppm (detection limit), the study authors conclude that β-arbutin is stable in the usual cosmetic formulation and that no hydroquinone is released under normal storage conditions for 3 years. overall conclusion:  β-arbutin is stable in final cosmetic formulations, hydroquinone content in the finished product was no more than 1 ppm (LLOQ) throughout the accelerated and longterm storage conditions (40°C, 75% relative humidity for 6 months and (25°C, 60% relative humidity for 36 months). β-arbutin was relatively stable to light when dissolved in a 10% ethanol aqueous solution. no significant change in the amount of β-arbutin was detected and only trace levels of hydroquinone (<0.25 ppm) were detected under the conditions of the ICH photostability test. β-arbutin was found to be unstable in low pH solutions, decrease of β-arbutin and significant increase of hydroquinone was observed, especially at pH 2. a recently published study(Yang CH et al. 2013) tested ß-arbutin (and deoxy-arbutin) at 10^-4 M (<0.003 % w/v) in aqueous solution with 10% propylene glycol and UV irradiation (narrow band UVB lightunit at 312 nm) at 2.65 mW/cm2: under these conditions (pH not given), ß-arbutin wasreduced to 43.5% of the initial level after 2 h of irradiation, and hydroquinone was detectedat significant levels (up to 20%) over the test period (up to 12 h). SCCS comment: as the test concentration is far below that used in cosmetic products, this study, Yang CH et al. is considered to be of limited relevance. the results presented in the respective studies regarding photostability testing (according to ICH guideline) and pH- or temperature-dependent stabilities of β-arbutin sound conclusive and reliable. In cosmetic formulations hydroquinone as impurity remained below 1 ppm (detection limit). yet, aside from reduced photostability under certain UV irradiation conditions (Yang et al. 2013), it is to be considered that β-arbutin may also undergo cutaneous hydrolysis into hydroquinone due to enzymatic activity through β-glucosidases in skin (Mier & van den Hurk 1976; Redoules et al. 2005) or via the activity of microbes residing on the surface of the skin (Bang et al. 2008).","the naturally occurring compound β-arbutin (4-hydroxyphenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, hydroquinone-β-glucopyranoside, CAS 497-76-7) is a β-D-glucopyranoside derivative of hydroquinone that can be found in the leaves and bark of many plants. it has been proposed for use as a skin-lightening agent, inhibiting production of the skin pigment melanin which is formed through a series of oxidative reactions involving the amino acid tyrosine and the enzyme tyrosinase. this enzyme catalyses the hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-DOPA (dihydroxyphenylalanine) and the oxidation of DOPA to dopaquinone which is then further metabolised to melanin. β-Arbutin is thought to act by inhibition of the activity of melanosomal tyrosinase, where the inhibition may be due to structural similarities to the substrate tyrosine (Zhu and Gao, 2008). β-arbutin can be hydrolysed both in acid solution and by enzymic action to hydroquinone which also acts as a skin lightening agent, again by inhibiting tyrosinase. Extended use of ≥2% hydroquinone, topically applied, has been associated with adverse effects including exogenous ochronosis in dark-skinned people. hydroquinone, like β-arbutin, is present in many dietary components in trace amounts and is metabolised in vivo to its glucuronide and sulphate conjugates. β-arbutin is proposed to be used as a skin-lightening agent in cosmetic face creams or face lotions at concentrations up to 7%.",,

SCCS comment on purity: purity of the active substance (non-ground or ground) based on HPLC peak area can only be reliable when 1) it is documented that all of the active substance and impurities loaded on the column were eluted and 2) the same results are obtained by HPLC performed using HPLC columns with two different stationary phases, for example reverse phase and normal phase HPLC columns. peak purity of the test compound in HPLC assay was not evaluated at λmax 332nm. sccs comment on impurities: impurities have been chemically characterised by the use of HPLC-PDA and LC-HRMS based on fragmentation pattern analysis. NMP and hydrazine have been identified as SVHC by ECHA and were included on 20 June 2011 in the candidate list of substances for eventual inclusion in Annex XIV of REACH (ED/31/2011). both NMP and hydrazine are, according to the applicant, unavoidable manufacturing impurities. NMP concentration varies from 830 to 3153 ppm in the 7 batches tested, while the concentration hydrazine was found to be less than 2 ppm. these two impurities should be accurately quantified in each batch. dry extract: 48,9 % (w/w), SCCS comment on solubility: it appears that 5,6,5',6'-tetraphenyl-3,3'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(1,2,4-triazine) is insoluble in water (solubility <0.02 µg/L). a solubility of 4.56 µg/ml of WP30, batch LP110 in aqueous 0.9% NaCl containing 3% bovine serum albumin was reported. compared to the active substance (S02374) which is sparingly insoluble in DMSO (0.10 mg/ml), the cosmetic ingredient S0771 is formulated with an emulsifier (eumulgin L), a preservative (benzoic acid) and water and presumably has a slightly different solubility. specific extinction coefficient ε: equal to 52492 L mol-1 cm-1; explosive properties: not explosive, oxidizing properties: absence of oxidizing properties;",

SCCS comments: percentage content of all of the impurities should be calculated at λmax = 246 nm of the test substance. quantitative determination of R0011102A (p-phenylenediamine) content by HPLC was carried out at 240 nm. to prove that the filtration does not interfere with the analysis of the test substance and impurities, a chromatogram obtained from the analysis of the sample before the filtration should be compared (“% area and retention times” of A166 and impurities, number of impurities) to a chromatogram obtained from the analysis of the same sample after filtration and under the same chromatographic conditions. during commenting period, in appendix 1, the applicant has two assays conducted before and after the filtration of the sample, under the same chromatographic conditions showing that the % area of the main product and impurities are comparable in these two assays. SCCS underlines that applicant should have clearly indicated which of the two assays have been conducted before or after filtration. considering MoS calculation based on added information provided by applicant during the public consultation period (i.e. NOAEL value of 200 mg/kg/day (NOAEL obtained in the 28- day oral toxicity study in rats – OECD 407 (1999)), SCCS agrees on the fact that the presence of the impurity 3-aminopropyl imidazole at a maximum level of 0.1% in methylimidazoliumpropyl p-phenylenediamine, Cl, 2HCl (A166) presents no or a negligible risk to human health. considering complementary information provided by applicant during the public consultation period, the exposure to the impurity chloroethane to be considered is equal to 100 microgram per day which is below the NSRL of 150 microgram/day. in addition, such an exposure of 100 microgram / day is far below the virtual safe dose (996 microgram/day) calculated based on the LTD10 with a MoE of 10000. SCCS agrees that the presence of the impurity chloroethane at a maximum level of 0.05% in methylimidazoliumpropyl pphenylenediamine, Cl, 2HCl (A166) is unlikely to present a risk to human health. one of the impurities, 4-aminophenylamine dihydrochloride (synonym p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride), has already been the subject of an SCCS opinion (SCCS/1443/11 revision of 18 september 2012), which raised concerns over its strong skin sensitising potency. the solubility was measured in water only. this study was conducted in compliance with: - OECD guideline for the testing of chemicals: N° 105 - water solubility adopted July 27, 1995. - OECD principles of good laboratory practice. test material batch R0027494A 008 L 002 (99.9% pure) was used in this study. a preliminary test for the water solubility was carried out. the water solubility of the test item was estimated to be greater than 1 kg/L in pure water at room temperature (20°C ± 5°C). at this high level of solubility, no pH-dependency could be observed. based on the guideline the shake flask method was used for the test performance for substances with solubility > 10 mg/L. test principle shake flask method the closed vessels containing (5 g test item, 1 ml solvent) were incubated in a shaking water bath at 30 °C for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively. soon after the start of the preincubation time, the samples appeared as deep dark brown solution with colourless crystals of 2-5 mm size inside. at the end of each incubation period the vessels were removed from the water bath and equilibrated for another 24 hours at 20 °C under shaking. the remaining test item was separated by filtration through a 0.45 μm syringe tip filter and analysed by HPLC / UV. the results showed no tendency to change over time and met all validity criteria, therefore the study is considered to be valid. based on the analyses, the solubility of the test item in water was determined to be 931 g/L at 20 °C. the determination of the concentration in the saturated solutions was done under usage of a quadratic regression. the arrangements made to prevent a possible oxidation of the test item (overlay with argon, addition of ascorbic acid in the solvent) seem to be sufficient. ref : Wöhr T.

these data in this submission is inadequate. many of the data cannot be linked to certain batches. this leads to many shortcomings: - only one batch (919151) was fully characterized for identity and impurities - all other batches were not sufficiently characterized - for all batches, the data on purity are insufficient - data on the stability and homogeneity of o-aminophenol or its formulations have not been supplied. conclusion: on the basis of the data provided no conclusions can be drawn neither with respect to the purity of o-aminophenol batches nor to the homogeneity or stability of o-aminophenol or its formulations. possible impurities that may originate from reagents and intermediate products of synthesis have been reported to be below limit of detection. this might be a hint that the state of the art syntheses of o-aminophenol lead to products with purities of about 99% or even better. in this case differing purities of o-aminophenol batches would have no influence on the toxicological evaluation. however, since descriptions of the synthesis are missing, this assumption cannot be ascertained.
