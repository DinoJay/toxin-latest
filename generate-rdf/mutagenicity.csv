This response was evaluated as positive because the revertant counts demonstrated a dose response, yielding average revertant counts of 4 for the vehicle, 6 to 8 at 5.0 to 50 μg per plate and 13 to 15 at 150 to 200 μg per plate, with the maximum revertant counts being outside of the upper 95% control limit of 13.

TA1537 strain is known for very low spontaneous revertant numbers (Mortelmans K., E. Zeiger. Mutation Research 455 (2000) 29–60, Ref. 21) hence detection of any inhibitory effect of an anti-oxidant on a relatively weak mutagenic effect of A33 is a priori more difficult, compared to other strains (TA98 and TA100). It would therefore be more relevant to conduct the studies in the latter two strains. - the effect of GSH on the mutagenic effect of A33 is not clear. the applicant admitted that the results with GSH at 15 µM “are positive with a 3.6-fold, maximum increase. the results are dose-responsive, and the mean revertant count at the dose level where the maximum fold increase was observed is outside of the 95% HCL”. the SCCS has performed additional statistical analysis of all the results, which indicate that: there was a significant effect of GSH at 5 µM when A33 was used at 150-250 µg/plate; no effect of GSH at 10 µM; and separated significant effects of GSH at 15 µM when A33 was used at 150 or 250 µg/plate. overall, the effects of GSH seemed to be random and not concentration-dependent.

UDS was reported as net grain counts/nucleus (the nuclear grain count subtracted with the number of grains in a nuclear sized area adjacent to each nucleus), the % cells responding or in repair and the population average of the nuclear grains for the sub-population of cells in repair. unscheduled DNA synthesis was determined in 50 randomly selected hepatocytes on 2 replicate slides per rat. Although OECD guidelines are not cited, the positive controls (AAF and DMN) are in accordance with the actual OECD guidelines. in the initial range finding study with treatments up to 2000 mg/kg bw, 2 rats died at 2000 mg/kg bw and one rat from the 1500 mg/kg bw group was killed in extremis. hence a dose of 1425 mg/kg bw was chosen as the appropriate high dose.p-aminophenol at doses of 285 and 1425 mg/kg bw yielded group mean net nuclear grain (NNG) values less than 0 for both sacrifice times and caused no significant increases in mean nuclear grain counts, as compared to controls. the percentage of cells in repair did not significantly differ from the control group and was well below the percentage required for a positive response. p-aminophenol did not induce DNAdamage leading to unscheduled DNA synthesis and, consequently, is not genotoxic in this in vivo UDS test in rats.

OPP treatment did not result in the formation of DNA adducts, including 8-OHdG formation, and DNA binding. based on in vitro tests, OPP has to be considered as a substance with genotoxic potential. however, the positive results were predominantly found in tests measuring chromosome aberrations (and sister chromatid exchanges) at high concentrations. OPP is clearly genotoxic due to its metabolites, PHQ and PBQ. the metabolites clearly have a genotoxic potential. however as this is due to cytotoxicity and the formation of ROS during metabolism and due to auto-oxidation of PHQ, it may be considered as an indirect genotoxic potential. under in vivo conditions, OPP induced an increase in the number of cells with chromosome aberrations as well but at high toxic doses. based on the present results, SCCS concludes that under normal physiological conditions OPP itself may be considered without genotoxic potential. if exposure increases up to highly toxic levels, metabolism is increased and detoxification is decreased, resulting in much ROS damage and the induction of structural and numerical chromosome aberrations. the results obtained from the genotoxicity studies with the metabolites PHQ and PBQ, indicating to a strong role for auto-oxidation and ROS formation, provide support for a mode of action involving genotoxic responses at dose levels of OPP that exceed the normal detoxification. EFSA (2008) concluded that studies showing positive in vitro genotoxicity are not relevant to humans as they have been obtained in cytotoxic concentrations. however, this argument is partly appropriate for indicative tests detecting DNA breaks (such as the comet assay), but not for mammalian gene mutation tests and chromosomal aberrations/micronucleus tests as these tests require to some extent cytotoxic concentrations for evaluation of genotoxicity. whereas protein binding was observed in liver, kidneys and bladder of rats fed OPP, so far DNA binding was shown for PHQ, but not for OPP up to doses of 1000 mg/kg.*) the chemicalstructure thought responsible for DNA adduct formation after PHQ administration is thoughtto be the semiquinone radical intermediate formed during interconversion between PHQ andPBQ. *) one study (ref. 297) that reports on a OPP-derived DNA-adduct in the title did not administer OPP, but SOPP, which becomes evident from the materials and methods section. in the results section, however, it was mentioned that rats were fed with OPP.

GLP: in compliance date: 24 november 1988 - 8 november 1989. o-aminophenol was investigated for the induction of unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in hepatocytes of rats. test concentrations were based on a toxicity range-finder study with doses up to the highest recommended dose of 2000 mg/kg bw. in the main experiment male rats were treated with 400 and 2000 mg/kg bw. to enable a manageable number of animals to be processed at a time, dosage was carried out on 2 separate days treating 3 animals from each dose group on each occasion. hepatocytes for UDS analysis were collected at 4 h and 12 h after administration of o-aminophenol by perfusion with collagenase. after plating the cells were incubated for 4 h with 10 µCi/ml 3 H-thymidine. evaluation of autoradiography was done after 14-15 days exposure. UDS was measured by determining nuclear grain count (the number of nuclear grains minus the number of grains in a adjacent area of the cytoplasma of the same size with the apparently highest number of grains and the mean and percentage cells in repair (cell with a net grain count larger than 5). unscheduled synthesis was determined in at least 50 randomly selected hepatocytes from at least 2 replicate cultures per rat. negative and positive controls were included. results: in the absence of toxicity in the range-finder study, the top dose of the main experiment was chosen to be 2000 mg/kg bw. in the main test one of the animals treated with 2000 mg/kg bw for the 12 h group died prior to perfusion. both for the 4 h and the 12 time-points after treatment an increased mean net nuclear grain count in the hepatocytes as compared to the untreated controls was not observed. also the number of in repair never reached the necessary criterion of 10% above the percentage found for the untreated control. conclusion: under the experimental conditions used o-aminophenol did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis and, consequently, is not genotoxic in rats in this in vivo UDS test. ref.: 38 (subm. IV). comment: the test was performed before the OECD guideline for the in vivo UDS test was developed. batch number, viability of the isolated hepatocytes and indications of biological availability of o-aminophenol were not reported.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the main experiment male rats were exposed orally on 2 consecutive days to 0, 500 and 1000 mg/kg bw/day. one h and 4 h (after the second application only) after each treatment and at the end of each treatment day rats were observed for mortality and clinical signs of stress. tissues were collected 4 ± 0.5 h after the last treatment. following exsanguination, the liver, duodenum and urinary bladder were collected. cells for analysis were obtained with a lysis procedure at pH=10. electrophoresis was performed at 0.7 V/cm, 300 ± 10 mA and 1°-10° C at the start of electrophoresis. parts of these tissues were used for histopathological examination. cytotoxicity was studied by low molecular weight (LMW) DNA diffusion analysis; cells with extensive DNA degradation associated with cell death exhibit a highly diffuse pattern of DNA compared to the condensed pattern associated with the high molecular weight DNA. per organ 100 nuclei were examined for olive tail moment (the distance between the centre of gravity of the DNA distribution in the tail and the centre of gravity of the DNA distribution in the head magnified with the fraction of DNA in the tail). relevant positive controls were included in the experiments. in the range finder test, immediately after dosing most rats showed lethargy with decreased movements. however, all animals recovered within 2 h. in the main test, identical clinical effects were observed in a number of rats. cytotoxicity, measured as the percentage of cells with LMW DNA, was statistically significantly and dose-dependently increased by 2-amino-5-ethylphenol phosphate treatment in the duodenum but not in the liver and urinary bladder. a dose dependent and statistically significant increase in DNA migration (olive tail moment) was observed in cells of the duodenum, but not in the liver and urinary bladder. slides from the duodenum of all treated groups and the negative control group were evaluated histopathogically. oral administration of 2-amino-5-ethylphenol phosphate resulted in a possible treatment related microscopic finding of subacute inflammation at 1000 mg/kg/bw/day. based on the cytotoxicity found at the same doses at which an increased migration was found, the clinical signs observed in these animals and the subacute inflammation, the increase in DNA migration is most likely due to cytotoxicity instead of genotoxicity. consequently the increase in DNA migration in cells of the duodenum is considered not biologically relevant. under the experimental conditions used, 2-amino-5-ethylphenol phosphate did not induce a biologically relevant increase in DNA migration in cells of the liver, duodenum and urinary bladder of rats and, consequently, 2-amino-5-ethylphenol phosphate is not genotoxic in this comet assay with rats. ref.: 34",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
