OPP and SOPP resulted in urinary bladder tumours (papilloma and carcinoma, mainly transitional cell papilloma and carcinoma) in male f344 rats. at higher doses, also the renal pelvis and the renal papilla are target tissues for OPPand SOPP toxicity. SOPP also induced kidney tumours in male f344 rats. liver tumours observed in male b6c3f1 mice are attributed to the high spontaneous rate for liver tumours in this strain of mice. if repeat-dose studies performed with OPP and SOPP are considered together with mechanistic, genotoxic and toxicokinetic studies, SCCS considers SOPP and OPP different with respect to potency and tumour induction (SOPP is of higher potency and available data does not allow to define a reliable threshold for SOPP). for OPP on the other hand, the coincidence of a variety of factors is required in order to induce tumour formation in bladder and kidneys of rats allowing the assumption of a threshold MOA for tumour formation. independent long-term repeat dose studies performed with OPP point to a threshold between 35 and 40 mg/kg bw/d. ",,,,,,"OPP and SOPP resulted in urinary bladder tumours (papilloma and carcinoma, mainly transitional cell papilloma and carcinoma) in male f344 rats. results from 2-generation toxicity studies performed with OPP in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrate that adverse effects on the urinary tract are not limited to the f344 rat strain. a shorter time to tumour was observed with increasing doses of OPP or SOPP. OPP and SOPP steep doseresponse-relationships were observed. however, in some instances (when very high doses were tested) lower incidences of bladder tumours were observed at highest doses tested when compared to the respective lower concentration. kidney tumours in male f344 rats receiving SOPP (mainly transitional cell carcinomas of renal pelvis and papilla) were reported from a study which did not correspond to the requirements of an in vivo carcinogenicity study. compared to bladder tumours observed in the same study, kidney tumours appeared at higher doses and with lower incidence. SOPP and OPP induced liver tumours in b6c3f1 mice (mainly hepatocellular tumors); however, the occurrence of hepatocellular tumours in this strain of rats might be attributed to the high spontaneous rate for liver tumours in this strain of mice (NTP, 2007; hasemann et al., 1998; battershill and fielder, 1998). applied dermally, OPP and SOPP did not induce tumours. therefore with respect to safety evaluation, focus is on bladder carcinogenicity of OPP and SOPP. an immense amount of mechanistic studies along with studies on metabolism and genotoxicity were used to assess whether a threshold MOA would be applicable for tumour induction of OPP and SOPP and whether bladder tumours might be of relevance for humans. with respect to OPP, a quite extensive database allowing identification a threshold dose is available, however it cannot be concluded that bladder tumours might not be of relevance  for humans. the data demonstrate, that by a combination of different requirements cytotoxicity on the urinary bladder epithelium is produced, which is followed by regenerative hyperplasia finally leading to tumours. among the different requirements considered necessary for bladder tumorigenesis are the following: - increased sodium concentration and increased pH in urine (alkaline urine and high sodium content contribute to tumour development); - pH dependent autoxidation of PHQ in urine; - formation of reactive species by - pH dependent autoxidation of PHQ in urine; - sufficient amounts of free PHQ in urine (e.g. sufficiently high dosages). there might be further contributing factors such as reduced formation of potentially cytoprotective prostaglandins in the urothel.  for SOPP on the other hand, there is clear indication that the substance is more potent with respect to urinary bladder carcinoma and that there are mechanistic differences between OPP and SOPP. amongst other factors, SOPP leads to higher sodium concentrations in urine and also to higher urinary pH. there is insufficient dose-response data available to draw a conclusion on the possibility of setting a threshold for SOPP induced carcinogenicity. the overall weight of evidence for OPP points to the fact that a threshold for bladder carcinogenicity exists. the assumption of a threshold MoA for bladder carcinogenicity in male rats treated with OPP is further supported by the following observations: • reversibility of effects (decreased urinary bladder hyperplasia after cessation of 13 weeks of exposure to OPP); • species- and strain-specific differences (OPP-induced bladder tumours were not observed in female rats, mice, dogs); • dermal application to mice does not affect tumour incidence in skin; • no skin tumour development induced by OPP metabolites; • tumours occur at high doses when sulfate and glucuronide conjugation pathways are saturated. the threshold for OPP-induced bladder tumours can be approached from different studies all yielding a quite consistent picture: in a 2-year bioassay in f344 rats (ref. 303), a NOAEL of 39 mg/kg bw/d was obtained based on urinary bladder hyperplasia and urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma. in a study investigating cytotoxicity and regenerative hyperplasia in male f344 rats fed different levels of OPP (ref. 263), no effects were observed at a dose level of 0.08 % OPP in diet (corresponding to approximately 40 mg/kg bw/d). in a 2-generation reproductive toxicity study performed in sprague-dawley rats, a NOAEL of 35 mg/kg bw/d was identified based on morphological changes in the urinary bladder (ref. 36)",,

Increases in numbers of hepatic tumours were observed at doses of 30 mg/kg body weight/day and higher. summary and noael values from the rodent carcinogenicity studies : three rodent lifetime bioassays have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of triclosan. triclosan produced hepatic effects and hepatic tumours in mice, but little evidence of toxicity and no tumours in rats. hamsters showed increased liver toxicity relative to the rat, but no tumours. no noael could be determined for the mouse, based on findings of liver effects at all doses (effects of hepatocyte hypertrophy and decreased plasma cholesterol). increased incidences of liver tumours were observed at doses of 30 mg/kg body weight/day and higher in mice. it should be noted that triclosan is a peroxisome proliferator in mouse liver. the noel for the rat study was determined by study investigators to be the mid-dose of 1,000 ppm, or ~48 mg/kg body weight/day for males and females combined, based on the finding of hepatocyte changes in the high-dose group of 3,000 ppm (~127 mg/kg body weight/day in males and 190 mg/kg body weight/day in females). although absolute adrenal weights were elevated at the 1,000 ppm dose in rats, this change was not considered to be adverse for a number of reasons, including a lack of change in relative adrenal weights, a lack of change in adrenal weights in the high-dose group, and the absence of accompanying histopathological changes in the adrenal glands. the noael for the hamster study was determined to be the mid-dose of 75 mg/kg body weight/day. although the values for certain haematologic parameters were significantly altered at doses of 12 and 75 mg/kg body weight/day, the erythroid changes were slight (on the order of 5 to 10%), and not considered to be adverse effects per se. an increase in triglycerides (40 to 50%) was not considered to be an adverse effect, as the increase was not accompanied by any changes in liver weight or histopathology. the noael values for the three rodent lifetime cancer bioassays are summarized below:  species : noael (mg/kg bw/day) : comment;  mouse : 10 (this value is a loel for tumour formation only) : no overall noael due to hepatotoxic effects observed at the lowest dose tested. there were no tumours observed in other tissues; rat :  ~48 (noael, 1000 ppm ~48 mg/kg body weight/day for males and females, combined : noael based on systemic toxicity. there was no evidence of tumour formation, including in liver. there was no evidence of hepatotoxicity; hamster : 75 : noael based on systemic toxicity. there was no evidence of tumour formation, including in liver. comment: according to the eu classification system, triclosan is not considered classifiable as a carcinogen. it should be noted that triclosan is a peroxisome proliferator in mouse liver.
