There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of nta treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on trisodium nitrilotriacetate (1) summarized the noaels and loaels from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated noaels varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated loaels varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this noael is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a nta concentration applied as 2.5% nta aqueous solution (2 ml, ? 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the noael for local effects on the rabbit dermis. sccs concurs in a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint after oral administration." ;

        ont:SCCS_comment_to_test   "the organ system that was mainly affected by repeated oral treatment with NTA is the urinary tract with lesions at several sites: in the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder. histomorphologic kidney lesions were discovered at several segments: the cortex area, the renal papilla and the renal pelvis. the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex region was found to be primarily affected. another target tissue was the transitional cell epithelium (urothelium) of the renal pelvis, the ureters and the urinary bladder. gross findings after repeated administration were red-brown discoloured urine, enlarged kidneys, increased kidney to body ratio, discoloured kidneys, rough surface of the kidneys, hydronephrosis (pelvic dilation) and dilated ureters. one of the predominant microscopic lesions induced by nta occurred primarily in the proximal tubules of the cortex region and was consistently reported as vacuolisation (of non-hyperplastic epithelial cells), degeneration of the tubular epithelium, and simple and nodular hyperplasia of the tubules. tubular hyperplasia was reported to be frequently associated with vacuolisation of tubular cells. There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of nta treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on trisodium nitrilotriacetate (1) summarized the noaels and loaels from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated noaels varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated loaels varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this noael is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a nta concentration applied as 2.5% nta aqueous solution (2 ml, ? 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the noael for local effects on the rabbit dermis. sccs concurs in a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint after oral administration." ;

the higher absolute neutrophil count may have represented an inflammatory response. effects on clinical chemistry test results were limited to higher bilirubin for females given 20 mg/kg bw/day (200% of the value in the control group), which, according to the study report authors could be associated with haemolysis, which would correlate with the haematology findings and pigment-laden macrophages observed in the liver. mean absolute and relative spleen weights were greater than control values in females given 20 mg/kg bw/day (125 and 129% of the control values, respectively). these weight differences were considered test article-related by the study report authors and correlated with an increased incidence of increased extramedullary haematopoiesis noted microscopically in this group. no statistically significant or test article-related organ weight changes were noted in animals at the recovery phase necropsy. all macroscopic findings were considered spontaneous, incidental, and/or unrelated to the test article by the study report authors.test article-related microscopic findings were noted in the liver and spleen of males and females at the dosing phase necropsy. test article-related findings in the liver includedminimal infiltrates of pigment-laden macrophages/kupffer cells in females given 20 mg/kg bw/day, and minimally increased prussian blue staining in males and females given 20 mg/kg bw/day. in the spleen, test article-related findings included minimal infiltrates of pigment-laden macrophages in males given 20 mg/kg bw/day, minimally increased extramedullary haematopoiesis in males and females given 20 mg/kg bw/day, and minimally increased prussian blue staining in males given 20 mg/kg bw/day and femalesgiven 8 or 20 mg/kg bw/day. prussian blue stain detects ferric ions in loosely bound protein complexes, as in hemosiderin. because increased prussian blue staining occurred concurrently with the presence of pigment-laden macrophages and/or kupffer cells in the liver and spleen, the pigment likely represented hemosiderin, according to the study report authors, and suggested red blood cell damage and/or haemolysis as a possible aetiology. this was further supported by the minimal to mild reduction in red blood cell mass in males given 20 mg/kg/day and females given 8 and 20 mg/kg bw/day. because evidence for effects on red blood cells persisted in the recovery phase females, the test article-related morphological changes were considered toxicologically relevant by the study report authors. no differences were observed in the 2.5 and the 5.0 mg/kg bw/day dose groups." ;

ULs for children were extrapolated from the UL for adults, based on allometric scaling (body weight to the power of 0.75). ULs were set at 800 ?g re/day for children aged 1–3 years, 1 100 ?g re/day for children aged 4–6 years, 1 500 ?g re/day for children aged 7–10 years, 2 000 ?g re/day for children aged 11–14 years and 2 600 ?g re/day for children aged 15–17 years. in a subsequent assessment which considered studies published until 2004, the scientific advisory committee on nutrition (sacn, 2005) concluded that the evidence of an association between high intake of retinol and poor bone health was inconsistent. the committee noted that some epidemiological data suggest that a retinol intake of 1500 ?g/day and above is associated with an increased risk of bone fracture; the evidence was considered not robust enough to set a safe upper level, and a guidance level for retinol intake of 1500 ?g/day was set for adults for individuals at greater risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture (particularly post-menopausal women) (efsa, 2008, 2013). the efsa nda panel (efsa, 2015) was aware that additional observational studies on possible associations between retinol and vitamin a intake and bone health have been published since the scf and sacn assessments. an overview of prospective cohort and nested case–control studies which investigated an association of retinol or “vitamin a” intake with the risk of bone fracture has been performed. based on this review, the panel considered that evaluation of the data published since the scf assessment does not change the conclusion from that of the scf with respect to the association between retinol or vitamin a intake and risk of bone fracture in postmenopausal women. in summary, the critical adverse effects of high intakes of vitamin a are different at different stages of life, such as bulging fontanelles in infants, decreased bone density and increased bone fracture in middle aged and elderly women, and teratogenicity in women of child-bearing age. hepatotoxicity and altered lipid metabolism are also relevant for adults." ;

creatinine: +16% and +22%, at 100 and 400 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). as these were not associated with any relevant microscopic findings, they were considered to be of minor toxicological significance. changes in blood glucose levels were also noted in the upper two dose groups (males: -8% and –11%; females: -10% and –9%, at 100 and 400 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). all individual values were close to or within the historical control range and the change was not considered to be of toxicological importance. some other haematological and biochemical parameters showed individual minor statistical differences, but these were not dose-related and were within the historical control range. there were no treatment-related changes in urinalysis. the absolute kidney weight was lower (87% of control) for males treated with 100 mg/kg bw/day, but not at the higher dose and it was therefore not considered to be relevant. there were no other significant differences in the organ weights. microscopic examination revealed minimal to slight brownish pigment accumulation in many organs and tissues (kidneys, alimentary tract, liver and /or mesenteric lymph nodes in animals given 100 or 400 mg/kg bw/day. tubular basophilia was noted in some animals of all male dose groups, including controls, but was more severe in males given 400 mg/kg bw/day. minimal to moderate subacute to chronic aspiration pneumonia was reported in 1/10 females at 25 mg/kg bw/day, 5/10 males and 6/10 females at 100 mg/kg bw/day and 5/10 males and 5/10 females at 400 mg/kg bw/day. brownish pigment-laden macrophages were present within the lesion for the animals of the two upper dose groups, but not for the female treated at 25 mg/kg bw/day. no other relevant changes were reported. remark: the aspiration pneumonia seen in one female rat at 25 mg/kg bw/day was disregarded as non-significant by the study authors, because of the absence of pigmentation. however, on the basis of the information provided, it is not appropriate to discount the possibility that the observation was treatment-related. this would lead to the conclusion that 25 mg/kg bw/day is a LOEL, rather than a NOEL. tubular basophilia is normally associated with regeneration following kidney damage. since it was also seen in controls in this study, the significance is unclear but may be related to exacerbation of a pre-existing condition." ;

There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of nta treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on trisodium nitrilotriacetate (1) summarized the noaels and loaels from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated noaels varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated loaels varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this noael is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a nta concentration applied as 2.5% nta aqueous solution (2 ml, ? 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the noael for local effects on the rabbit dermis. sccs concurs in a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint after oral administration." ;

There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of nta treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on trisodium nitrilotriacetate (1) summarized the noaels and loaels from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated noaels varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated loaels varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this noael is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a nta concentration applied as 2.5% nta aqueous solution (2 ml, ? 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the noael for local effects on the rabbit dermis. sccs concurs in a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint after oral administration." ;

Reproductive data evaluation showed that neither the mating nor the fertility parameters were adversely affected by the test item treatment or administration of the placebo. however, in the placebo control females, a slightly low mean number of corpora lutea, and slightly low mean number of implantations, pups delivered and live pups on day 1 postpartum were obtained. the results for all groups are summarized in the table. the observation of the pups after birth did not reveal any increased incidence of pups dying, adverse effects on the pup body weight gains or influence on the pups’ sex ratio; furthermore, gross malformations were not found in any of the pups. at the post-mortem examinations of the f0 generation parent animals, test item treatmentrelated macroscopic observations were not revealed. none of the differences in organ weights noted between the placebo and control groups or between the test item-treated and the placebo groups were considered to be of toxicological importance. qualitative staging for testis did not indicate any abnormalities in the integrity of the various cell types present within the different stages of the spermatogenic cycle. the oestrous stages were not affected by test item or placebo treatments, and microscopic abnormalities were not revealed in the evaluation of the ovarian follicles and corpora lutea or in the evaluation of the uterus. overall, nanosized eth50 did not show adverse effects to the systemic toxicity endpoints, mating and reproduction parameters, offspring survival to 5 days of age, or to grossly and microscopically evaluated organs and tissues." ;

OPP induced nonneoplastic lesions in the kidneys (p<0.05 when all severity grades are combined) at the low, mid, and high doses. in addition to the increased incidence, the lesion severity (e.g., tubular epithelium degeneration) also appeared to increase with dose. reduced (p<0.05) absolute kidney weights occurred in each of the OPP-treated groups (7-24 %), but the dose-response seemed consistent with the general body weight reductions noted in these groups (12-43 %)." ;

There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of nta treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on trisodium nitrilotriacetate (1) summarized the noaels and loaels from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated noaels varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated loaels varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this noael is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a nta concentration applied as 2.5% nta aqueous solution (2 ml, ? 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the noael for local effects on the rabbit dermis. sccs concurs in a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint after oral administration." ;

a statistically significant decreased grip strength of both forelimb and hind limb in group 4 was attributed to the reduced body weight of the animals. haematology results showed a significant (p<0.05) increase in methaemoglobin levels in males and females of the high dose group. a dose-related decrease of the number of white blood cells (p<0.01) was noted in high dose males along with a significantly (p<0.01)reduced absolute number of lymphocytes; these changes were considered dose-related. clinical biochemistry parameters showed a significant (p<0.01) increase of gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in rats of the high dose group (212 % and 202 % in males and females, respectively). the high dose group animals also showed significant (p<0.01) decreases in creatinine levels, in amount of total protein accompanied by disproteinemia, and in urea and uric acid levels. glucose, total bilirubin and phospholipids levels were decreased in high dose males; total cholesterol, creatine kinase and alkaline phosphatase were increased in high dose females. no abnormalities were revealed by urinalysis results. decreased (p<0.05) absolute organ weights and/or organ weight ratios of most organs were recorded for males in the mid and high dose groups and for females in the high dose group. macroscopically, there was a reddish discoloration of the forestomach mucosa, the thymus was reduced in size (high dose), and the thyroid gland was discoloured red-brown (mid dose) or black (high dose). the microscopic findings occurred mainly in the high dose group and included the following: minimal to slight diffuse hepatocellular hypertrophy associated with moderately increased incidence of focal necrosis, and decreased haematopoiesis. the spleen showed a decreased incidence of increased haematopoiesis. in the kidneys an increased incidence of intratubular granular casts and transitional cell hyperplasia occurred in females. non-glandular stomach dilation was observed in one male and one female in the high dose group and most of the high dose animals showed congestion; a low incidence of glandular stomach erosion also occurred. in the thymus, the observed cortical atrophy was considered as a condition of stress rather than an immunotoxic effect. the ovaries showed an interstitial cell hyperplasia considered as a non-neoplastic proliferation of cellular components of the interstitial gland. an increased diffuse fatty change was observed in the adrenal cortices of males and females of the high dose group. thyroid of mid- and high-dose males and females showed an increased incidence of follicular cell hypertrophy, pigmented colloid, and pigmented follicular cells. the pituitary gland of males of these two groups showed an increased incidence of TSH/ACTH cell hypertrophy." ;

No elevation in AST concentration was observed at the end of the study in males or females at doses of up to 10 mg/kg bw/d. At 20 mg/kg bw/d, mean AST concentrations were elevated in males and females at the end of the study as some animals clearly exceeded historical control ranges.

        ont:SCCS_comment_to_test        "the organ system that was mainly affected by repeated oral treatment with NTA is the urinary tract with lesions at several sites: in the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder. histomorphologic kidney lesions were discovered at several segments: the cortex area, the renal papilla and the renal pelvis. the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex region was found to be primarily affected. another target tissue was the transitional cell epithelium (urothelium) of the renal pelvis, the ureters and the urinary bladder. gross findings after repeated administration were red-brown discoloured urine, enlarged kidneys, increased kidney to body ratio, discoloured kidneys, rough surface of the kidneys, hydronephrosis (pelvic dilation) and dilated ureters. one of the predominant microscopic lesions induced by nta occurred primarily in the proximal tubules of the cortex region and was consistently reported as vacuolisation (of non-hyperplastic epithelial cells), degeneration of the tubular epithelium, and simple and nodular hyperplasia of the tubules. tubular hyperplasia was reported to be frequently associated with vacuolisation of tubular cells. There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of nta treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on trisodium nitrilotriacetate (1) summarized the noaels and loaels from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated noaels varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated loaels varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this noael is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a nta concentration applied as 2.5% nta aqueous solution (2 ml, ? 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the noael for local effects on the rabbit dermis. sccs concurs in a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint after oral administration." ;

There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of nta treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on trisodium nitrilotriacetate (1) summarized the noaels and loaels from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated noaels varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated loaels varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this noael is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a nta concentration applied as 2.5% nta aqueous solution (2 ml, ? 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the noael for local effects on the rabbit dermis. sccs concurs in a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint after oral administration." ;

        ont:additional_info            "test substance: tetrabromophenol blue" , "reassessment by the sccs: in 2004, only a draft study report was submitted. the final report has now been provided, but it does not change the previous opinion. the sccs commented on the discrepancy in interpretation by the study authors between the eye irritation test and the 90-day study. a 2% solution of tetrabromophenol blue was not classified as an eye irritant, but in the 90-day study, 100 mg per kg bw/d; (equivalent to a 2% solution) the corneal opacities in males (1 mid and 4 high dose) were attributed to direct eye contact, causing local irritation, as microscopic eye examination did not reveal any other treatment-related lesions. chromodacryorrhoea was not considered toxicologically significant. however, there was a dose related increase in the occurrence and severity of chromodacryorrhoea in females by the end of the dosing period. this suggests that these could be cholinergic effects, since overproduction of porphyrin from the harderian gland is indicative of a non-specific response to stress. the three females (1 mid and 2 high dose) that exhibited behavioural changes also had chromodacryorrhoea, which supports this. this, in conjunction with the higher incidence of corneal opacities in males, suggests that the ophthalmic effects were systemic rather than due to direct contact. the statistically significant reduced platelet and urea values (high-dose males), and increased cholesterol values (high-dose females) were considered to be not toxicologically significant as they were within the normal variation for rats of this age and strain. comments submitted under the public consultation to the sccs opinion on tetrabromophenol blue, colipa n° c183 (sccs/1479/11, adopted 26-27 June 2012): the applicant would like to comment that the findings on corneal opacity in the sub-chronic study are not inconsistent with the negative findings in the eye irritation study. a comparison of both study results is not possible because a single dose of the test material was used in the irritation study vs. repeated potential eye exposure in the sub-chronic oral toxicity study. repeated exposure to the eye as a result of grooming behaviour, and microlesions on the cornea occurring as a result of grooming, could very easily have produced an irritant or corrosive effect on the eye. blue discoloration of the fur is suggestive of such exposure to the test material occurring as a result of grooming behaviour. bacterial infections of microlesions of the cornea are known to directly induce degenerative processes, which will cause corneal opacity. furthermore, no degenerative processes (protein denaturation and accompanying light reflection disturbance) were observed in the lens and the vitreous body during histopathological examination. therefore, a systemic effect is considered unlikely. the applicant would also like to comment on the changes in the erythrocyte count in males observed at 10 and 100 mg/ kg bw. although statistically significant, in our opinion these observations can be concluded to be normal variations within the physiological range for that strain and age. the lack of histopathological evidence for a disturbance of haematopoiesis in the spleen, the bone marrow or the liver supports that interpretation. finally, the applicant would like to comment on the observed chromodacryorrhea in the treated animals. although there was a higher incidence in treated females, chromodacryorrhea was also observed in controls. chromodacryorrhea can occur as a non-specific response to stress, especially to environmental stress. treatment with a test material could induce a higher level of stress and lead to a higher incidence of chromodacryorrhea in a treatment-related manner (discomfort after gavage, bad taste, etc.). if a direct cholinergic effect was involved, a clear dose response relationship would be expected, i.e., a ten-fold difference in dose between the mid and high dose would be expected to lead to a dramatic increase in chromodacryorrhea, this was not observed. therefore, the applicant considers that a direct cholinergic effect of the test material is unlikely. based on the arguments above, the applicant concludes that a noael of 100 mg/kg bw/day (expressed as administered dose) is justified for the 90-day oral toxicity study. the applicant acknowledges that this difference in interpretation regarding the noael from this study does not impact the MoS calculation because the applicant has used the noael from the developmental toxicity study (3 mg/kg bw/day) for the calculation. reassessment by the sccs: the current sccs agrees with the previous evaluation of the sccnfp in 2004, as well as with the reassessment of the previous sccs, i.e. the NOAEL is 3 mg/kg bw/day based on the ophthalmological and haematological findings at the higher dose levels in this study. the noael of 3 mg/kg bw/day is taken forward to the MoS calculation." ;

(1992) have shown that incidence and severity of cardiac fibroses in the same strain of rats could be reduced by food restriction (i.e. lower body weight gain). analysis of the weight gains of rats revealed, that weight gains in females in the imai (1991) study were suppressed by 52.5 – 55 % compared to controls and at this body weight reduction – when compared to controls - grade 2-3 fibrosis was significantly reduced, whereas grade 1 fibrosis was increased. in the study by wahle and christenson (1996) body weight gains of females at the highest opp dose were reduced by 15 % compared to controls. it is questionable whether this reduction of body weight reduction would have had an effect on the prevention of cardiac degeneration and fibrosis.

There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of nta treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on trisodium nitrilotriacetate (1) summarized the noaels and loaels from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated noaels varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated loaels varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this noael is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a nta concentration applied as 2.5% nta aqueous solution (2 ml, ? 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the noael for local effects on the rabbit dermis. sccs concurs in a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint after oral administration." ;

There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of nta treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on trisodium nitrilotriacetate (1) summarized the noaels and loaels from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated noaels varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated loaels varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this noael is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a nta concentration applied as 2.5% nta aqueous solution (2 ml, ? 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the noael for local effects on the rabbit dermis. sccs concurs in a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint after oral administration." ;

moderate increase in the leukocyte count and in the mean relative and absolute values of neutrophils in the high dose group; at this high dose group effects on lymphocytes and monocyte count were observed. these effects were considered test item related and were reversible at the end of the recovery period. non dose related platelet effects were also observed in the males from the medium and high dose group. clinical biochemistry changes were observed in males and females from the high dose group only at the end of the treatment. these effects may reflect metabolic changes. effects on the electrolyte parameters Na+, Cl- (males and females) were observed and related to the nature of the test item itself (sodium salt) and most of these effects regressed during recovery. some minor changes in parameters of urinalysis were observed in males and females rats from the high dose group and urine discoloration in males rats from the medium dose group. increase in urine turbidity was also observed in male rats from the high dose group. all these effects were reversible after the recovery period. increase in liver, kidney and spleen weights and in their ratios to body and brain weights were observed at the end of treatment in rats from the high dose group. these effects were considered related to the treatment. they were reversible after the recovery period. decreases in mean testes weights, testes to body and brain weights ratios were observed in male rats from the high dose group at the end of treatment. these effects were not reversible after the recovery period. decreases in mean epididymidis weights, epididymidis to body and brain weights ratios were observed in male rats from the high dose group at the end of the recovery period but not during the treatment. macroscopic and microscopic examination after terminal necropsy showed lesions in the testes and epididymides of male rats from the high dose group: size reduction of testes (in nine rats) and epididymides (in six rats) and concerning epididymides thickening (in one rat), nodules (in one rat), foci (in two rats) or cysts (in two rats). severe tubular degeneration, sperm granuloma, azoospermia or oligospermia were reported on the testis of nine rats from the high dose group; these lesions were also observed after the recovery period. as prostate and seminal vesicles were not affected, the authors considered that a testosterone effect is unlikely and the lesions recorded are considered to be of primary cytotoxic nature to sperm. macroscopic lesions (foci or thickening) were also observed on stomach, caecum or mesenteric lymph nodes of some male or female rats. icroscopic findings on gastrointestinal tracts as ulceration or inflammation, fibrosis were reported on some male or female rats from the medium or high dose groups, some of them were always observed after the recovery period. microscopic findings were reported in the spleen and bone marrow in rats from the high dose group of both sexes (extramedullary and medullary hemopoiesis), in the liver in male or female rats from the medium or high dose groups (hepatocellular hypertrophy, in the kidneys in male or female rats from the medium or high dose groups (tubular cell swelling) and in the adrenals in male rats from the high dose group (cortical vacuolation). these findings were not longer present after the recovery period. extramedullary and medullary hemopoiesis were considered by the authors of minor severity degrees and secondary to intestinal perforation, inflammation and haemorrhage. hepatocellular hypertrophy was considered to be of adaptative metabolic nature. increased cortical vacuolation in adrenals was considered related to stress hormone production (fatty change) and the nature of the renal lesions was considered unclear." ;

There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of nta treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on trisodium nitrilotriacetate (1) summarized the noaels and loaels from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated noaels varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated loaels varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this noael is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a nta concentration applied as 2.5% nta aqueous solution (2 ml, ? 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the noael for local effects on the rabbit dermis. sccs concurs in a noael of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint after oral administration." ;
