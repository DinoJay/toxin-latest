Overall, mainly based on clinical studies, and already since 2012, the SCCS considers BMHCA as an “established contact allergen in humans” (SCCS, 2012). subm 2: The study confirms that, while p-BMHCA is a sensitiser, however, the risk of sensitisation at current use levels is low.",,"subm 2: Schnuch et al., 2015 (SMII: 23)","subm I other clinical data : Published data on positive patch-test reactions in various clinical studies (mostly patients attending a dermatology clinic) have been summarised (SCCS 2012: SCCS/1459/11). BMHCA scored ++, indicating that between 11 and 100 positive reactions have been recorded. The frequency of the positive reactions against 5% BMHCA varied from 0% to 1.2% (Larsen et al. 1996; 2 out of 167 individuals); in most studies it was below 0.6%. subm 2 other clinical data: Recently, the working group of Schnuch et al. 2015 analysed the frequency of sensitisation to 26 fragrances in 5451 products including p-BMHCA to be labelled according to current EU legislation. Use volumes were provided by the International Fragrance Association (IFRA). Data on sensitization frequency generated by the Information Network of Departments of Dermatology (IVDK) network between 2007 and 2009 and specifically 2008 were used. Results of patch testing on the 26 labelled fragrances (1870 patients (in 2008: n=823) were analysed. The proportion of reactions to single constituents in breakdown testing in fragrance mix positives from testing the standard series was extrapolated to the study population (n = 1870) yielding the frequency of sensitisation to single constituents. The relative frequency of sensitisation was calculated as the share of sensitisation to a single allergen (%) relative to the total of sensitisation (=100%) to fragrances. Sensitisation exposure quotient (SEQ) as an estimate of sensitisation risk associated with exposure to the respective fragrance was calculated as the quotient of the relative frequency of sensitisation divided by the relative frequency of use. The SEQ varied greatly, offering a ranking regarding risk of sensitisation. Although p-BMHCA was highly used in terms of the relative volume sold (standardised market share) of 19.42%, only 0.7% of the 1870 patients tested showed a positive allergic reaction. The share of positive reactions to p-BMHCA was calculated to be 2.9% (confidence interval (CI): 1.5 - 4.9) and the resulting sensitisation exposure quotient (SEQ) of 0.15 indicated a low risk of sensitisation.
