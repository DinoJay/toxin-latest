Signs of liver effects, increases in cholesterol (both sexes) and hypertrophy (males only) were seen at the lowest dose of 10 mg/kg body weight/day. hypertrophy was seen in mice of both sexes at 30 mg/kg body weight/day, and increases in liver function enzyme levels were seen in mice of both sexes at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight/day. Increases in numbers of hepatic tumours were observed at doses of 30 mg/kg body weight/day and higher. summary and noael values from the rodent carcinogenicity studies : three rodent lifetime bioassays have been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of triclosan. triclosan produced hepatic effects and hepatic tumours in mice, but little evidence of toxicity and no tumours in rats. hamsters showed increased liver toxicity relative to the rat, but no tumours. no noael could be determined for the mouse, based on findings of liver effects at all doses (effects of hepatocyte hypertrophy and decreased plasma cholesterol). increased incidences of liver tumours were observed at doses of 30 mg/kg body weight/day and higher in mice. it should be noted that triclosan is a peroxisome proliferator in mouse liver. the noel for the rat study was determined by study investigators to be the mid-dose of 1,000 ppm, or ~48 mg/kg body weight/day for males and females combined, based on the finding of hepatocyte changes in the high-dose group of 3,000 ppm (~127 mg/kg body weight/day in males and 190 mg/kg body weight/day in females). although absolute adrenal weights were elevated at the 1,000 ppm dose in rats, this change was not considered to be adverse for a number of reasons, including a lack of change in relative adrenal weights, a lack of change in adrenal weights in the high-dose group, and the absence of accompanying histopathological changes in the adrenal glands. the noael for the hamster study was determined to be the mid-dose of 75 mg/kg body weight/day. although the values for certain haematologic parameters were significantly altered at doses of 12 and 75 mg/kg body weight/day, the erythroid changes were slight (on the order of 5 to 10%), and not considered to be adverse effects per se. an increase in triglycerides (40 to 50%) was not considered to be an adverse effect, as the increase was not accompanied by any changes in liver weight or histopathology. the noael values for the three rodent lifetime cancer bioassays are summarized below:  species : noael (mg/kg bw/day) : comment;  mouse : 10 (this value is a loel for tumour formation only) : no overall noael due to hepatotoxic effects observed at the lowest dose tested. there were no tumours observed in other tissues; rat :  ~48 (noael, 1000 ppm ~48 mg/kg body weight/day for males and females, combined : noael based on systemic toxicity. there was no evidence of tumour formation, including in liver. there was no evidence of hepatotoxicity; hamster : 75 : noael based on systemic toxicity. there was no evidence of tumour formation, including in liver. comment: according to the eu classification system, triclosan is not considered classifiable as a carcinogen. it should be noted that triclosan is a peroxisome proliferator in mouse liver.
