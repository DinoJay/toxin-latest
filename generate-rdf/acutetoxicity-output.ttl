(2007), sunscreen sprayable formulations should be dispensed with droplet size of more than 30 µm (mmad) with not more than 1% of droplets of aerodynamic diameter at or below 10 µm. the authors concluded that for nanosized eth50 the inhalation LC50 is greater than the highest technically achievable aerosol concentration level of 4.976 mg formulation/L air, or greater than 0.4976 mg eth50/L air, according to this study’s results with mmad of about 1.2 µm. a notable but reversible lung inflammatory response occurred which is considered a normal non-allergenic type response to particle exposures." ;
