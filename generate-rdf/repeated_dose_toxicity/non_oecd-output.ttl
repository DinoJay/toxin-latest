There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of NTA treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on Trisodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) (1) summarized the NOAELs and LOAELs from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated NOAELs varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated LOAELs varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a NOAEL of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this NOAEL is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a NTA concentration applied as 2.5% NTA aqueous solution (2 ml, ≈ 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the NOAEL for local effects on the rabbit  dermis.

Overall SCCS comment to the submitted subacute toxicity studies:Two oral 28-day studies – one in rats and the other in dogs – are included in Submission II and in the Company Submission and described above. The SCCS notes that these two 28- day subacute toxicity studies were also included in Submission I. The SCCP concluded that the quality of the dossier was such that an adequate assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride (P97) was not possible. In addition to these two studies, Submission II (and Submission I) also includes two other oral 28-day studies. None of these studies have been evaluated in this Opinion because they were either submitted as a poorly legible pdf-file or were only described in secondary literature and therefore, are not considered to add any valuable information for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a cosmetic ingredient.

SCCS considers the argumeNTAtion by CalEPA to consider 49 mg/kg bw/d as LOAEL based on cardiac degeneration as not robust enough to set a LOAEL based on the following grounds: (1) the incidence of cardiac degeneration and fibrosis was in general very high which indicates that age of the rats might have contributed to this finding (2) there was no dose-relationship and at the highest dose, the incidence was 46 %, i.e. lower than in controls. calepa argues that low incidences of cardiac degeneration and fibrosis in the high dose group might be due to reduced weight gain in that group. imai et al. (1992) have shown that incidence and severity of cardiac fibroses in the same strain of rats could be reduced by food restriction (i.e. lower body weight gain). analysis of the weight gains of rats revealed, that weight gains in females in the imai (1991) study were suppressed by 52.5 – 55 % compared to controls and at this body weight reduction – when compared to controls - grade 2-3 fibrosis was significantly reduced, whereas grade 1 fibrosis was increased. in the study by wahle and christenson (1996) body weight gains of females at the highest OPP dose were reduced by 15 % compared to controls. it is questionable whether this reduction of body weight reduction would have had an effect on the prevention of cardiac degeneration and fibrosis. (3) cardiac degeneration and fibrosis was not observed in other long-term study performed with OPP and SOPP. (e.g. in mice treated with SOPP, hagiwara et al., 1984)" ;

ULs for children were extrapolated from the UL for adults, based on allometric scaling (body weight to the power of 0.75). ULs were set at 800 μg re/day for children aged 1–3 years, 1 100 μg re/day for children aged 4–6 years, 1 500 μg re/day for children aged 7–10 years, 2 000 μg re/day for children aged 11–14 years and 2 600 μg re/day for children aged 15–17 years. in a subsequent assessment which considered studies published until 2004, the scientific advisory committee on nutrition (sacn, 2005) concluded that the evidence of an association between high iNTAke of retinol and poor bone health was inconsistent. the committee noted that some epidemiological data suggest that a retinol iNTAke of 1500 μg/day and above is associated with an increased risk of bone fracture; the evidence was considered not robust enough to set a safe upper level, and a guidance level for retinol iNTAke of 1500 μg/day was set for adults for individuals at greater risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture (particularly post-menopausal women) (efsa, 2008, 2013). the efsa nda panel (efsa, 2015) was aware that additional observational studies on possible associations between retinol and Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) iNTAke and bone health have been published since the scf and sacn assessments. an overview of prospective cohort and nested case–control studies which investigated an association of retinol or “Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate)” iNTAke with the risk of bone fracture has been performed. based on this review, the panel considered that evaluation of the data published since the scf assessment does not change the conclusion from that of the scf with respect to the association between retinol or Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) iNTAke and risk of bone fracture in postmenopausal women. in summary, the critical adverse effects of high iNTAkes of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) are different at different stages of life, such as bulging foNTAnelles in infants, decreased bone density and increased bone fracture in middle aged and elderly women, and teratogenicity in women of child-bearing age. hepatotoxicity and altered lipid metabolism are also relevant for adults. the LOAEL of preformed Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) identified by scf as causing these adverse effects are shown below. effect : lowest dose (per person); bulging foNTAnelles : 7 500 μg RE, single dose; hepatotoxicity : 7 500 μg RE/day; altered lipid metabolism : 7 500 μg RE/day; decreased bone density/increased bone fracture : 1 500 μg RE/day; teratogenicity : >3 000 μg RE/day " ;

                "the SCCS considers that the teratogenic potential of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) and effects on liver and local effects in the skin are the most critical toxicological endpoints. for assessing the systemic toxicity of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) after cosmetic exposure, the SCCS has relied on the tolerable upper iNTAke level (UL) for preformed Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) of: - 3 000 μg re/day (or 10 000 IU) for women of childbearing age and men. the UL also apply during pregnancy and lactation. - 800 μg re/day (2700 IU) for children aged 1–3 years, - 1 100 μg re/day (3700 IU) for children aged 4–6 years, - 1 500 μg re/day (5000 IU) for children aged 7–10 years, - 2 000 μg re/day (6700 IU) for children aged 11–14 years and  2 600 μg re/day (8700 IU) for children aged 15–17 years. to take into account more susceptible population groups such as women suffering from osteoporosis or children above 6 years old who may also be exposed to Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) via cosmetic products, SCCS will use the value of 1500 μg re/day (5000 IU) for the safety assessment of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) in cosmetic products. this value will be appropriate for women of childbearing age and also for middle age and elderly women who may suffer decreasing bone density, as well as for men and children. based on information provided by the applicants, Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) and esters are not currently used for children in the EU. however, application of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate)-coNTAining baby skin care products, such as body lotions and creams, are considered by the SCCS relevant for 1- and 3-years old children. therefore, based on a theoretical scenario, exposure to Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) viathese products has been assessed in this opinion. for children aged 1-3 years SCCS will use the value of 800 μg re/day (2700 IU) for the safety assessment of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) in cosmetic products. for children aged 4-6 years SCCS will use the value of 1100 μg re/day (3700 IU) for the safety assessment of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) in cosmetic products. moreover, the SCCS is aware that undesirable effects can also arise from a lack of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate). therefore population reference iNTAke values are recommended which is the level of iNTAke that is adequate for virtually all people in a population group. for Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate), the recommended values by efsa are as shown in follow: age 7-11 months:  population reference iNTAke (µg/day) 250; 1-3years: 250µg/d; 4-6 years: 300µg/d: 7-10 years: 400µg/d; 11-14years:600µg/d; 15-17 years(m): 750µg/d: 15-17 years (f): 650µg/d; ≥18 years (m): 750µg/d; ≥18 years (f): 650µg/d; pregnancy: 700µg/d; lactation:1300µg/d" ;

Argyria is characterised by the deposition of inert precipitates of silver selenide and silver sulphide and may be observed in numerous organs and tissues, but is not associated with toxicity (Greene & Su, 1987; ATSDR, 1990; Faust, 1992; EPA, 1996; Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003; Lansdown, 2010). Silver is widely distributed and consequently deposition may occur in any organs, however the liver is widely identified as the principle organ of silver deposition due to its role in the excretion of silver. In patients with high levels of hepatocellular deposition, silver is precipitated as inert, lysosomally bound deposits; findings are not associated with any evidence of liver malfunction or toxicity." ;

                "The principle effect of repeated exposure to silver in humans and experimental animal species is argyria, where the rate of absorption of silver exceeds the rate of biliary or urinary excretion. Argyria is characterised by the deposition of inert precipitates of silver selenide and silver sulphide and may be observed in numerous organs and tissues, but is not associated with toxicity (Greene & Su, 1987; ATSDR, 1990; Faust, 1992; EPA, 1996; Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003; Lansdown, 2010). Silver is widely distributed and consequently deposition may occur in any organs, however the liver is widely identified as the principle organ of silver deposition due to its role in the excretion of silver. In patients with high levels of hepatocellular deposition, silver is precipitated as inert, lysosomally bound deposits; findings are not associated with any evidence of liver malfunction or toxicity." ;

There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of NTA treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on Trisodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) (1) summarized the NOAELs and LOAELs from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated NOAELs varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated LOAELs varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a NOAEL of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this NOAEL is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a NTA concentration applied as 2.5% NTA aqueous solution (2 ml, ≈ 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the NOAEL for local effects on the rabbit  dermis.

                "the full reports of two 90-day feeding studies of Cetylpyridinium chloride (one in rats and the other in dogs) were submitted to efsa for the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of cecure® (ref.: 24); the active ingredient in cecure® is Cetylpyridinium chloride. in addition, a third 90-day rat study was crucial for the setting of the NOAEL for Cetylpyridinium chloride in the efsa opinion. the two rat studies which are also considered of relevance for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a cosmetic ingredient are summarised below, based on the descriptions in the efsa opinion. the cef panel considered that the 90-day dog study was not suitable for the derivation of a NOAEL; thus, this study is not considered of relevance for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a cosmetic ingredient and therefore, not included in this opinion. Overall SCCS conclusion on repeated dose toxicity: based on the submitted 6-month repeated dose toxicity study in rats described above, a NOAEL for local effects of 5 mg/kg bw/day is considered. The local effects observed in the stomach of rats are probably due to the irritative properties of Cetylpyridinium chloride and related to the administration of the test material as aqueous solution (by gavage in water). The SCCS also considers 5 mg/kg bw/day as a NOAEL for systemic toxicity (decreased body weight gain in females, 86% of control) although it can be argued that the decreased body weight gain might be secondary to the local effects in the stomach. However, in the dietary studies reported in the efsa opinion, decreased body weight gain was also reported for rats. no local effects (irritation) were observed in the gastrointestinal tract indicating that the irritative properties of Cetylpyridinium chloride could be avoided by administration in the feed instead of an aqueous solution (by gavage in water). A NOAEL for decreased body weight gain of 25 mg/kg bw/day can be considered based on the sub-acute studies and of around 40 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day studies. from the 90-day studies, the cef panel identified a NOAEL of 18 mg/kg bw/day, based on increased relative caecum weights in male rats in one of the 90-day study. the cef panel considered the increase in caecum weight as relevant for risk characterisation. The SCCS agrees with the evaluation of the efsa cef panel. For dermal application, the dietary studies reported in the efsa opinion are considered as more relevant for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride than the gavage studies submitted by the applicant. Consequently, the NOAEL of 18 mg/kg bw/day identified by the cef panel is used for the mos calculation for use of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a preservative in skin lotions and creams, as well as in anti-perspirant deodorants, cf. terms of reference. For oral application, the gavage studies submitted by the applicant are considered as more relevant for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride than the dietary studies reported in the efsa opinion. consequently, the NOAEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day identified in the submitted 6-month study is used in the safety assessment for the MoS calculation for use of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a preservative in mouthwashes cosmetic products, as well as in all other oral hygiene cosmetic products, cf. terms of reference." ;

There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of NTA treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on Trisodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) (1) summarized the NOAELs and LOAELs from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated NOAELs varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated LOAELs varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a NOAEL of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this NOAEL is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a NTA concentration applied as 2.5% NTA aqueous solution (2 ml, ≈ 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the NOAEL for local effects on the rabbit  dermis.

SOPP also affected the kidneys and urinary bladder, as well as the liver, in rats. the liver effects of SOPP included significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase (alt) activity in the males and females. kidney effects induced by SOPP in both sexes included increased organ weight and pyelonephritis. ingestion of SOPP (but not OPP) favoured the excretion of alkaline urine in both sexes of rats. subchronic oral toxicity data are also available for mice (SOPP) and dogs (OPP). except for body weight reduction, mice (both sexes) fed diets coNTAining up to 40000 ppm SOPP for 13 weeks showed no treatment-related pathology in the liver, kidney, and bladder. in both sexes of dogs, OPP induced a dose-dependent increase in emetic activity. in a 4-week dermal exposure study of OPP in mice (both sexes), the only effect reported was ulcerative skin lesions. no repeat dose studies were provided for pOPP." ;

SOPP also affected the kidneys and urinary bladder, as well as the liver, in rats. the liver effects of SOPP included significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase (alt) activity in the males and females. kidney effects induced by SOPP in both sexes included increased organ weight and pyelonephritis. ingestion of SOPP (but not OPP) favoured the excretion of alkaline urine in both sexes of rats. subchronic oral toxicity data are also available for mice (SOPP) and dogs (OPP). except for body weight reduction, mice (both sexes) fed diets coNTAining up to 40000 ppm SOPP for 13 weeks showed no treatment-related pathology in the liver, kidney, and bladder. in both sexes of dogs, OPP induced a dose-dependent increase in emetic activity. in a 4-week dermal exposure study of OPP in mice (both sexes), the only effect reported was ulcerative skin lesions. no repeat dose studies were provided for pOPP." ;

ULs for children were extrapolated from the UL for adults, based on allometric scaling (body weight to the power of 0.75). ULs were set at 800 μg re/day for children aged 1–3 years, 1 100 μg re/day for children aged 4–6 years, 1 500 μg re/day for children aged 7–10 years, 2 000 μg re/day for children aged 11–14 years and 2 600 μg re/day for children aged 15–17 years. in a subsequent assessment which considered studies published until 2004, the scientific advisory committee on nutrition (sacn, 2005) concluded that the evidence of an association between high iNTAke of retinol and poor bone health was inconsistent. the committee noted that some epidemiological data suggest that a retinol iNTAke of 1500 μg/day and above is associated with an increased risk of bone fracture; the evidence was considered not robust enough to set a safe upper level, and a guidance level for retinol iNTAke of 1500 μg/day was set for adults for individuals at greater risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture (particularly post-menopausal women) (efsa, 2008, 2013). the efsa nda panel (efsa, 2015) was aware that additional observational studies on possible associations between retinol and Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) iNTAke and bone health have been published since the scf and sacn assessments. an overview of prospective cohort and nested case–control studies which investigated an association of retinol or “Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate)” iNTAke with the risk of bone fracture has been performed. based on this review, the panel considered that evaluation of the data published since the scf assessment does not change the conclusion from that of the scf with respect to the association between retinol or Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) iNTAke and risk of bone fracture in postmenopausal women. in summary, the critical adverse effects of high iNTAkes of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) are different at different stages of life, such as bulging foNTAnelles in infants, decreased bone density and increased bone fracture in middle aged and elderly women, and teratogenicity in women of child-bearing age. hepatotoxicity and altered lipid metabolism are also relevant for adults. the LOAEL of preformed Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) identified by scf as causing these adverse effects are shown below. effect : lowest dose (per person); bulging foNTAnelles : 7 500 μg RE, single dose; hepatotoxicity : 7 500 μg RE/day; altered lipid metabolism : 7 500 μg RE/day; decreased bone density/increased bone fracture : 1 500 μg RE/day; teratogenicity : >3 000 μg RE/day " ;

                "the SCCS considers that the teratogenic potential of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) and effects on liver and local effects in the skin are the most critical toxicological endpoints. for assessing the systemic toxicity of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) after cosmetic exposure, the SCCS has relied on the tolerable upper iNTAke level (UL) for preformed Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) of: - 3 000 μg re/day (or 10 000 IU) for women of childbearing age and men. the UL also apply during pregnancy and lactation. - 800 μg re/day (2700 IU) for children aged 1–3 years, - 1 100 μg re/day (3700 IU) for children aged 4–6 years, - 1 500 μg re/day (5000 IU) for children aged 7–10 years, - 2 000 μg re/day (6700 IU) for children aged 11–14 years and  2 600 μg re/day (8700 IU) for children aged 15–17 years. to take into account more susceptible population groups such as women suffering from osteoporosis or children above 6 years old who may also be exposed to Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) via cosmetic products, SCCS will use the value of 1500 μg re/day (5000 IU) for the safety assessment of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) in cosmetic products. this value will be appropriate for women of childbearing age and also for middle age and elderly women who may suffer decreasing bone density, as well as for men and children. based on information provided by the applicants, Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) and esters are not currently used for children in the EU. however, application of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate)-coNTAining baby skin care products, such as body lotions and creams, are considered by the SCCS relevant for 1- and 3-years old children. therefore, based on a theoretical scenario, exposure to Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) viathese products has been assessed in this opinion. for children aged 1-3 years SCCS will use the value of 800 μg re/day (2700 IU) for the safety assessment of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) in cosmetic products. for children aged 4-6 years SCCS will use the value of 1100 μg re/day (3700 IU) for the safety assessment of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) in cosmetic products. moreover, the SCCS is aware that undesirable effects can also arise from a lack of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate). therefore population reference iNTAke values are recommended which is the level of iNTAke that is adequate for virtually all people in a population group. for Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate), the recommended values by efsa are as shown in follow: age 7-11 months:  population reference iNTAke (µg/day) 250; 1-3years: 250µg/d; 4-6 years: 300µg/d: 7-10 years: 400µg/d; 11-14years:600µg/d; 15-17 years(m): 750µg/d: 15-17 years (f): 650µg/d; ≥18 years (m): 750µg/d; ≥18 years (f): 650µg/d; pregnancy: 700µg/d; lactation:1300µg/d" ;

                "effects on the urinary tract: the organ system that was mainly affected by repeated oral treatment with NTA is the urinary tract with lesions at several sites: in the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder. histomorphologic kidney lesions were discovered at several segments: the cortex area, the renal papilla and the renal pelvis. the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex region was found to be primarily affected. another target tissue was the transitional cell epithelium (urothelium) of the renal pelvis, the ureters and the urinary bladder. gross findings after repeated administration were red-brown discoloured urine, enlarged kidneys, increased kidney to body ratio, discoloured kidneys, rough surface of the kidneys, hydronephrosis (pelvic dilation) and dilated ureters. one of the predominant microscopic lesions induced by NTA occurred primarily in the proximal tubules of the cortex region and was consistently reported as vacuolisation (of non-hyperplastic epithelial cells), degeneration of the tubular epithelium, and simple and nodular hyperplasia of the tubules. tubular hyperplasia was reported to be frequently associated with vacuolisation of tubular cells. There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of NTA treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on Trisodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) (1) summarized the NOAELs and LOAELs from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated NOAELs varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated LOAELs varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a NOAEL of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this NOAEL is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a NTA concentration applied as 2.5% NTA aqueous solution (2 ml, ≈ 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the NOAEL for local effects on the rabbit  dermis.

SOPP also affected the kidneys and urinary bladder, as well as the liver, in rats. the liver effects of SOPP included significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase (alt) activity in the males and females. kidney effects induced by SOPP in both sexes included increased organ weight and pyelonephritis. ingestion of SOPP (but not OPP) favoured the excretion of alkaline urine in both sexes of rats. subchronic oral toxicity data are also available for mice (SOPP) and dogs (OPP). except for body weight reduction, mice (both sexes) fed diets coNTAining up to 40000 ppm SOPP for 13 weeks showed no treatment-related pathology in the liver, kidney, and bladder. in both sexes of dogs, OPP induced a dose-dependent increase in emetic activity. in a 4-week dermal exposure study of OPP in mice (both sexes), the only effect reported was ulcerative skin lesions. no repeat dose studies were provided for pOPP." ;

Argyria is characterised by the deposition of inert precipitates of silver selenide and silver sulphide and may be observed in numerous organs and tissues, but is not associated with toxicity (Greene & Su, 1987; ATSDR, 1990; Faust, 1992; EPA, 1996; Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003; Lansdown, 2010). Silver is widely distributed and consequently deposition may occur in any organs, however the liver is widely identified as the principle organ of silver deposition due to its role in the excretion of silver. In patients with high levels of hepatocellular deposition, silver is precipitated as inert, lysosomally bound deposits; findings are not associated with any evidence of liver malfunction or toxicity." ;

                "effects on the urinary tract: the organ system that was mainly affected by repeated oral treatment with NTA is the urinary tract with lesions at several sites: in the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder. histomorphologic kidney lesions were discovered at several segments: the cortex area, the renal papilla and the renal pelvis. the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex region was found to be primarily affected. another target tissue was the transitional cell epithelium (urothelium) of the renal pelvis, the ureters and the urinary bladder. gross findings after repeated administration were red-brown discoloured urine, enlarged kidneys, increased kidney to body ratio, discoloured kidneys, rough surface of the kidneys, hydronephrosis (pelvic dilation) and dilated ureters. one of the predominant microscopic lesions induced by NTA occurred primarily in the proximal tubules of the cortex region and was consistently reported as vacuolisation (of non-hyperplastic epithelial cells), degeneration of the tubular epithelium, and simple and nodular hyperplasia of the tubules. tubular hyperplasia was reported to be frequently associated with vacuolisation of tubular cells. There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of NTA treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on Trisodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) (1) summarized the NOAELs and LOAELs from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated NOAELs varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated LOAELs varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a NOAEL of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this NOAEL is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a NTA concentration applied as 2.5% NTA aqueous solution (2 ml, ≈ 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the NOAEL for local effects on the rabbit  dermis.

ULs for children were extrapolated from the UL for adults, based on allometric scaling (body weight to the power of 0.75). ULs were set at 800 μg re/day for children aged 1–3 years, 1 100 μg re/day for children aged 4–6 years, 1 500 μg re/day for children aged 7–10 years, 2 000 μg re/day for children aged 11–14 years and 2 600 μg re/day for children aged 15–17 years. in a subsequent assessment which considered studies published until 2004, the scientific advisory committee on nutrition (sacn, 2005) concluded that the evidence of an association between high iNTAke of retinol and poor bone health was inconsistent. the committee noted that some epidemiological data suggest that a retinol iNTAke of 1500 μg/day and above is associated with an increased risk of bone fracture; the evidence was considered not robust enough to set a safe upper level, and a guidance level for retinol iNTAke of 1500 μg/day was set for adults for individuals at greater risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture (particularly post-menopausal women) (efsa, 2008, 2013). the efsa nda panel (efsa, 2015) was aware that additional observational studies on possible associations between retinol and Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) iNTAke and bone health have been published since the scf and sacn assessments. an overview of prospective cohort and nested case–control studies which investigated an association of retinol or “Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate)” iNTAke with the risk of bone fracture has been performed. based on this review, the panel considered that evaluation of the data published since the scf assessment does not change the conclusion from that of the scf with respect to the association between retinol or Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) iNTAke and risk of bone fracture in postmenopausal women. in summary, the critical adverse effects of high iNTAkes of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) are different at different stages of life, such as bulging foNTAnelles in infants, decreased bone density and increased bone fracture in middle aged and elderly women, and teratogenicity in women of child-bearing age. hepatotoxicity and altered lipid metabolism are also relevant for adults. the LOAEL of preformed Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) identified by scf as causing these adverse effects are shown below. effect : lowest dose (per person); bulging foNTAnelles : 7 500 μg RE, single dose; hepatotoxicity : 7 500 μg RE/day; altered lipid metabolism : 7 500 μg RE/day; decreased bone density/increased bone fracture : 1 500 μg RE/day; teratogenicity : >3 000 μg RE/day " ;

                "effects on the urinary tract: the organ system that was mainly affected by repeated oral treatment with NTA is the urinary tract with lesions at several sites: in the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder. histomorphologic kidney lesions were discovered at several segments: the cortex area, the renal papilla and the renal pelvis. the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex region was found to be primarily affected. another target tissue was the transitional cell epithelium (urothelium) of the renal pelvis, the ureters and the urinary bladder. gross findings after repeated administration were red-brown discoloured urine, enlarged kidneys, increased kidney to body ratio, discoloured kidneys, rough surface of the kidneys, hydronephrosis (pelvic dilation) and dilated ureters. one of the predominant microscopic lesions induced by NTA occurred primarily in the proximal tubules of the cortex region and was consistently reported as vacuolisation (of non-hyperplastic epithelial cells), degeneration of the tubular epithelium, and simple and nodular hyperplasia of the tubules. tubular hyperplasia was reported to be frequently associated with vacuolisation of tubular cells. There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of NTA treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on Trisodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) (1) summarized the NOAELs and LOAELs from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated NOAELs varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated LOAELs varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a NOAEL of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this NOAEL is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a NTA concentration applied as 2.5% NTA aqueous solution (2 ml, ≈ 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the NOAEL for local effects on the rabbit  dermis.

                "the full reports of two 90-day feeding studies of Cetylpyridinium chloride (one in rats and the other in dogs) were submitted to efsa for the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of CECURE® (ref.: 24); the active ingredient in CECURE® is Cetylpyridinium chloride. In addition, a third 90-day rat study was crucial for the setting of the NOAEL for Cetylpyridinium chloride in the efsa opinion. the two rat studies which are also considered of relevance for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a cosmetic ingredient are summarised below, based on the descriptions in the efsa opinion. the cef panel considered that the 90-day dog study was not suitable for the derivation of a NOAEL; thus, this study is not considered of relevance for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a cosmetic ingredient and therefore, not included in this opinion. Overall SCCS conclusion on repeated dose toxicity: based on the submitted 6-month repeated dose toxicity study in rats described above, a NOAEL for local effects of 5 mg/kg bw/day is considered. The local effects observed in the stomach of rats are probably due to the irritative properties of Cetylpyridinium chloride and related to the administration of the test material as aqueous solution (by gavage in water). The SCCS also considers 5 mg/kg bw/day as a NOAEL for systemic toxicity (decreased body weight gain in females, 86% of control) although it can be argued that the decreased body weight gain might be secondary to the local effects in the stomach. However, in the dietary studies reported in the efsa opinion, decreased body weight gain was also reported for rats. no local effects (irritation) were observed in the gastrointestinal tract indicating that the irritative properties of Cetylpyridinium chloride could be avoided by administration in the feed instead of an aqueous solution (by gavage in water). A NOAEL for decreased body weight gain of 25 mg/kg bw/day can be considered based on the sub-acute studies and of around 40 mg/kg bw/day based on the 90-day studies. from the 90-day studies, the cef panel identified a NOAEL of 18 mg/kg bw/day, based on increased relative caecum weights in male rats in one of the 90-day study. the cef panel considered the increase in caecum weight as relevant for risk characterisation. The SCCS agrees with the evaluation of the efsa cef panel. For dermal application, the dietary studies reported in the efsa opinion are considered as more relevant for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride than the gavage studies submitted by the applicant. Consequently, the NOAEL of 18 mg/kg bw/day identified by the cef panel is used for the mos calculation for use of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a preservative in skin lotions and creams, as well as in anti-perspirant deodorants, cf. terms of reference. For oral application, the gavage studies submitted by the applicant are considered as more relevant for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride than the dietary studies reported in the efsa opinion. consequently, the NOAEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day identified in the submitted 6-month study is used in the safety assessment for the MoS calculation for use of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a preservative in mouthwashes cosmetic products, as well as in all other oral hygiene cosmetic products, cf. terms of reference." ;

SOPP also affected the kidneys and urinary bladder, as well as the liver, in rats. the liver effects of SOPP included significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase (alt) activity in the males and females. kidney effects induced by SOPP in both sexes included increased organ weight and pyelonephritis. ingestion of SOPP (but not OPP) favoured the excretion of alkaline urine in both sexes of rats. subchronic oral toxicity data are also available for mice (SOPP) and dogs (OPP). except for body weight reduction, mice (both sexes) fed diets coNTAining up to 40000 ppm SOPP for 13 weeks showed no treatment-related pathology in the liver, kidney, and bladder. in both sexes of dogs, OPP induced a dose-dependent increase in emetic activity. in a 4-week dermal exposure study of OPP in mice (both sexes), the only effect reported was ulcerative skin lesions. no repeat dose studies were provided for pOPP." ;

                "effects on the urinary tract: the organ system that was mainly affected by repeated oral treatment with NTA is the urinary tract with lesions at several sites: in the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder. histomorphologic kidney lesions were discovered at several segments: the cortex area, the renal papilla and the renal pelvis. the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex region was found to be primarily affected. another target tissue was the transitional cell epithelium (urothelium) of the renal pelvis, the ureters and the urinary bladder. gross findings after repeated administration were red-brown discoloured urine, enlarged kidneys, increased kidney to body ratio, discoloured kidneys, rough surface of the kidneys, hydronephrosis (pelvic dilation) and dilated ureters. one of the predominant microscopic lesions induced by NTA occurred primarily in the proximal tubules of the cortex region and was consistently reported as vacuolisation (of non-hyperplastic epithelial cells), degeneration of the tubular epithelium, and simple and nodular hyperplasia of the tubules. tubular hyperplasia was reported to be frequently associated with vacuolisation of tubular cells. There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of NTA treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on Trisodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) (1) summarized the NOAELs and LOAELs from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated NOAELs varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated LOAELs varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a NOAEL of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this NOAEL is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a NTA concentration applied as 2.5% NTA aqueous solution (2 ml, ≈ 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the NOAEL for local effects on the rabbit  dermis.

Overall SCCS comment to the submitted subacute toxicity studies:Two oral 28-day studies – one in rats and the other in dogs – are included in Submission II and in the Company Submission and described above. The SCCS notes that these two 28- day subacute toxicity studies were also included in Submission I. The SCCP concluded that the quality of the dossier was such that an adequate assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride (P97) was not possible. In addition to these two studies, Submission II (and Submission I) also includes two other oral 28-day studies. None of these studies have been evaluated in this Opinion because they were either submitted as a poorly legible pdf-file or were only described in secondary literature and therefore, are not considered to add any valuable information for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a cosmetic ingredient." ;

Argyria is characterised by the deposition of inert precipitates of silver selenide and silver sulphide and may be observed in numerous organs and tissues, but is not associated with toxicity (Greene & Su, 1987; ATSDR, 1990; Faust, 1992; EPA, 1996; Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003; Lansdown, 2010). Silver is widely distributed and consequently deposition may occur in any organs, however the liver is widely identified as the principle organ of silver deposition due to its role in the excretion of silver. In patients with high levels of hepatocellular deposition, silver is precipitated as inert, lysosomally bound deposits; findings are not associated with any evidence of liver malfunction or toxicity." ;

                "The principle effect of repeated exposure to silver in humans and experimental animal species is argyria, where the rate of absorption of silver exceeds the rate of biliary or urinary excretion. Argyria is characterised by the deposition of inert precipitates of silver selenide and silver sulphide and may be observed in numerous organs and tissues, but is not associated with toxicity (Greene & Su, 1987; ATSDR, 1990; Faust, 1992; EPA, 1996; Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003; Lansdown, 2010). Silver is widely distributed and consequently deposition may occur in any organs, however the liver is widely identified as the principle organ of silver deposition due to its role in the excretion of silver. In patients with high levels of hepatocellular deposition, silver is precipitated as inert, lysosomally bound deposits; findings are not associated with any evidence of liver malfunction or toxicity." ;

SOPP also affected the kidneys and urinary bladder, as well as the liver, in rats. the liver effects of SOPP included significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase (alt) activity in the males and females. kidney effects induced by SOPP in both sexes included increased organ weight and pyelonephritis. ingestion of SOPP (but not OPP) favoured the excretion of alkaline urine in both sexes of rats. subchronic oral toxicity data are also available for mice (SOPP) and dogs (OPP). except for body weight reduction, mice (both sexes) fed diets coNTAining up to 40000 ppm SOPP for 13 weeks showed no treatment-related pathology in the liver, kidney, and bladder. in both sexes of dogs, OPP induced a dose-dependent increase in emetic activity. in a 4-week dermal exposure study of OPP in mice (both sexes), the only effect reported was ulcerative skin lesions. no repeat dose studies were provided for pOPP." ;

                "SCCS conclusion on subacute and subchronic dose toxicity: the toxicity of bmHC a after repeated application was investigated in several species. decreases in body weights and food consumption and/or clinical signs of toxicity were observed after subacute oral administration of bmHC a at doses of ≥50 mg/kg bw/day (rats) and ≥200 mg/kg bw/day (dogs). irrespective of the length of treatment period, in oral studies rats were found more sensitive than dogs to this compound. clinical chemistry and histopathological examinations repeatedly revealed adverse effects on the liver and male reproductive system (testicular toxicity; cf. 3.3.8.). decreases in plasma cholinesterase activity levels in both sexes of rats were observed after oral exposure to ≥25 mg/kg bw/day for 90 days. in addition, effects on adrenal glands in females were also observed at the same dose levels. from this most meaningful oral study, with respect to the doses administered, a NOAEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day can be derived for systemic effects. on the other hand, dermal administration in rats for 5 days led to adverse effects (including testicular toxicity) only at excessive dose levels (2000 mg/kg bw/day). no 90-day studies on dermal or inhalative administration were available.

ULs for children were extrapolated from the UL for adults, based on allometric scaling (body weight to the power of 0.75). ULs were set at 800 μg re/day for children aged 1–3 years, 1 100 μg re/day for children aged 4–6 years, 1 500 μg re/day for children aged 7–10 years, 2 000 μg re/day for children aged 11–14 years and 2 600 μg re/day for children aged 15–17 years. in a subsequent assessment which considered studies published until 2004, the scientific advisory committee on nutrition (sacn, 2005) concluded that the evidence of an association between high iNTAke of retinol and poor bone health was inconsistent. the committee noted that some epidemiological data suggest that a retinol iNTAke of 1500 μg/day and above is associated with an increased risk of bone fracture; the evidence was considered not robust enough to set a safe upper level, and a guidance level for retinol iNTAke of 1500 μg/day was set for adults for individuals at greater risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture (particularly post-menopausal women) (efsa, 2008, 2013). the efsa nda panel (efsa, 2015) was aware that additional observational studies on possible associations between retinol and Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) iNTAke and bone health have been published since the scf and sacn assessments. an overview of prospective cohort and nested case–control studies which investigated an association of retinol or “Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate)” iNTAke with the risk of bone fracture has been performed. based on this review, the panel considered that evaluation of the data published since the scf assessment does not change the conclusion from that of the scf with respect to the association between retinol or Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) iNTAke and risk of bone fracture in postmenopausal women. in summary, the critical adverse effects of high iNTAkes of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) are different at different stages of life, such as bulging foNTAnelles in infants, decreased bone density and increased bone fracture in middle aged and elderly women, and teratogenicity in women of child-bearing age. hepatotoxicity and altered lipid metabolism are also relevant for adults. the LOAEL of preformed Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) identified by scf as causing these adverse effects are shown below. effect : lowest dose (per person); bulging foNTAnelles : 7 500 μg RE, single dose; hepatotoxicity : 7 500 μg RE/day; altered lipid metabolism : 7 500 μg RE/day; decreased bone density/increased bone fracture : 1 500 μg RE/day; teratogenicity : >3 000 μg RE/day " ;

                "the SCCS considers that the teratogenic potential of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) and effects on liver and local effects in the skin are the most critical toxicological endpoints. for assessing the systemic toxicity of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) after cosmetic exposure, the SCCS has relied on the tolerable upper iNTAke level (UL) for preformed Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) of: - 3 000 μg re/day (or 10 000 IU) for women of childbearing age and men. the UL also apply during pregnancy and lactation. - 800 μg re/day (2700 IU) for children aged 1–3 years, - 1 100 μg re/day (3700 IU) for children aged 4–6 years, - 1 500 μg re/day (5000 IU) for children aged 7–10 years, - 2 000 μg re/day (6700 IU) for children aged 11–14 years and  2 600 μg re/day (8700 IU) for children aged 15–17 years. to take into account more susceptible population groups such as women suffering from osteoporosis or children above 6 years old who may also be exposed to Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) via cosmetic products, SCCS will use the value of 1500 μg re/day (5000 IU) for the safety assessment of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) in cosmetic products. this value will be appropriate for women of childbearing age and also for middle age and elderly women who may suffer decreasing bone density, as well as for men and children. based on information provided by the applicants, Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) and esters are not currently used for children in the EU. however, application of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate)-coNTAining baby skin care products, such as body lotions and creams, are considered by the SCCS relevant for 1- and 3-years old children. therefore, based on a theoretical scenario, exposure to Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) viathese products has been assessed in this opinion. for children aged 1-3 years SCCS will use the value of 800 μg re/day (2700 IU) for the safety assessment of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) in cosmetic products. for children aged 4-6 years SCCS will use the value of 1100 μg re/day (3700 IU) for the safety assessment of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) in cosmetic products. moreover, the SCCS is aware that undesirable effects can also arise from a lack of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate). therefore population reference iNTAke values are recommended which is the level of iNTAke that is adequate for virtually all people in a population group. for Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate), the recommended values by efsa are as shown in follow: age 7-11 months:  population reference iNTAke (µg/day) 250; 1-3years: 250µg/d; 4-6 years: 300µg/d: 7-10 years: 400µg/d; 11-14years:600µg/d; 15-17 years(m): 750µg/d: 15-17 years (f): 650µg/d; ≥18 years (m): 750µg/d; ≥18 years (f): 650µg/d; pregnancy: 700µg/d; lactation:1300µg/d" ;

                "effects on the urinary tract: the organ system that was mainly affected by repeated oral treatment with NTA is the urinary tract with lesions at several sites: in the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder. histomorphologic kidney lesions were discovered at several segments: the cortex area, the renal papilla and the renal pelvis. the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex region was found to be primarily affected. another target tissue was the transitional cell epithelium (urothelium) of the renal pelvis, the ureters and the urinary bladder. gross findings after repeated administration were red-brown discoloured urine, enlarged kidneys, increased kidney to body ratio, discoloured kidneys, rough surface of the kidneys, hydronephrosis (pelvic dilation) and dilated ureters. one of the predominant microscopic lesions induced by NTA occurred primarily in the proximal tubules of the cortex region and was consistently reported as vacuolisation (of non-hyperplastic epithelial cells), degeneration of the tubular epithelium, and simple and nodular hyperplasia of the tubules. tubular hyperplasia was reported to be frequently associated with vacuolisation of tubular cells. There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of NTA treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on Trisodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) (1) summarized the NOAELs and LOAELs from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated NOAELs varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated LOAELs varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a NOAEL of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this NOAEL is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a NTA concentration applied as 2.5% NTA aqueous solution (2 ml, ≈ 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the NOAEL for local effects on the rabbit  dermis.

This was believed to be stress induced, resulting from the initiation of wrapping procedures. No other significant body weight or body change differences were noted in females. There were no adverse observations related to the treatment. The only observable effect was a blue staining of the dosed area in all dose groups. Clinical observations related to the dosing procedure were evident in some animals from all dose groups. These included scabbed areas in the area of the dose site caused by repeated tape removal. There were no observations of erythema or oedema of the dosed area." ;

                "The principle effect of repeated exposure to silver in humans and experimental animal species is argyria, where the rate of absorption of silver exceeds the rate of biliary or urinary excretion. Argyria is characterised by the deposition of inert precipitates of silver selenide and silver sulphide and may be observed in numerous organs and tissues, but is not associated with toxicity (Greene & Su, 1987; ATSDR, 1990; Faust, 1992; EPA, 1996; Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003; Lansdown, 2010). Silver is widely distributed and consequently deposition may occur in any organs, however the liver is widely identified as the principle organ of silver deposition due to its role in the excretion of silver. In patients with high levels of hepatocellular deposition, silver is precipitated as inert, lysosomally bound deposits; findings are not associated with any evidence of liver malfunction or toxicity." ;

                "effects on the urinary tract: the organ system that was mainly affected by repeated oral treatment with NTA is the urinary tract with lesions at several sites: in the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder. histomorphologic kidney lesions were discovered at several segments: the cortex area, the renal papilla and the renal pelvis. the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex region was found to be primarily affected. another target tissue was the transitional cell epithelium (urothelium) of the renal pelvis, the ureters and the urinary bladder. gross findings after repeated administration were red-brown discoloured urine, enlarged kidneys, increased kidney to body ratio, discoloured kidneys, rough surface of the kidneys, hydronephrosis (pelvic dilation) and dilated ureters. one of the predominant microscopic lesions induced by NTA occurred primarily in the proximal tubules of the cortex region and was consistently reported as vacuolisation (of non-hyperplastic epithelial cells), degeneration of the tubular epithelium, and simple and nodular hyperplasia of the tubules. tubular hyperplasia was reported to be frequently associated with vacuolisation of tubular cells. There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of NTA treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on Trisodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) (1) summarized the NOAELs and LOAELs from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated NOAELs varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated LOAELs varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a NOAEL of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this NOAEL is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a NTA concentration applied as 2.5% NTA aqueous solution (2 ml, ≈ 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the NOAEL for local effects on the rabbit  dermis.

ULs for children were extrapolated from the UL for adults, based on allometric scaling (body weight to the power of 0.75). ULs were set at 800 μg re/day for children aged 1–3 years, 1 100 μg re/day for children aged 4–6 years, 1 500 μg re/day for children aged 7–10 years, 2 000 μg re/day for children aged 11–14 years and 2 600 μg re/day for children aged 15–17 years. in a subsequent assessment which considered studies published until 2004, the scientific advisory committee on nutrition (sacn, 2005) concluded that the evidence of an association between high iNTAke of retinol and poor bone health was inconsistent. the committee noted that some epidemiological data suggest that a retinol iNTAke of 1500 μg/day and above is associated with an increased risk of bone fracture; the evidence was considered not robust enough to set a safe upper level, and a guidance level for retinol iNTAke of 1500 μg/day was set for adults for individuals at greater risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture (particularly post-menopausal women) (efsa, 2008, 2013). the efsa nda panel (efsa, 2015) was aware that additional observational studies on possible associations between retinol and Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) iNTAke and bone health have been published since the scf and sacn assessments. an overview of prospective cohort and nested case–control studies which investigated an association of retinol or “Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate)” iNTAke with the risk of bone fracture has been performed. based on this review, the panel considered that evaluation of the data published since the scf assessment does not change the conclusion from that of the scf with respect to the association between retinol or Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) iNTAke and risk of bone fracture in postmenopausal women. in summary, the critical adverse effects of high iNTAkes of Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) are different at different stages of life, such as bulging foNTAnelles in infants, decreased bone density and increased bone fracture in middle aged and elderly women, and teratogenicity in women of child-bearing age. hepatotoxicity and altered lipid metabolism are also relevant for adults. the LOAEL of preformed Vitamin A (Retinol, Retinyl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate) identified by scf as causing these adverse effects are shown below. effect : lowest dose (per person); bulging foNTAnelles : 7 500 μg RE, single dose; hepatotoxicity : 7 500 μg RE/day; altered lipid metabolism : 7 500 μg RE/day; decreased bone density/increased bone fracture : 1 500 μg RE/day; teratogenicity : >3 000 μg RE/day " ;

Argyria is characterised by the deposition of inert precipitates of silver selenide and silver sulphide and may be observed in numerous organs and tissues, but is not associated with toxicity (Greene & Su, 1987; ATSDR, 1990; Faust, 1992; EPA, 1996; Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003; Lansdown, 2010). Silver is widely distributed and consequently deposition may occur in any organs, however the liver is widely identified as the principle organ of silver deposition due to its role in the excretion of silver. In patients with high levels of hepatocellular deposition, silver is precipitated as inert, lysosomally bound deposits; findings are not associated with any evidence of liver malfunction or toxicity." ;

                "The principle effect of repeated exposure to silver in humans and experimental animal species is argyria, where the rate of absorption of silver exceeds the rate of biliary or urinary excretion. Argyria is characterised by the deposition of inert precipitates of silver selenide and silver sulphide and may be observed in numerous organs and tissues, but is not associated with toxicity (Greene & Su, 1987; ATSDR, 1990; Faust, 1992; EPA, 1996; Juberg, 1997; WHO, 2003; Lansdown, 2010). Silver is widely distributed and consequently deposition may occur in any organs, however the liver is widely identified as the principle organ of silver deposition due to its role in the excretion of silver. In patients with high levels of hepatocellular deposition, silver is precipitated as inert, lysosomally bound deposits; findings are not associated with any evidence of liver malfunction or toxicity." ;

                "effects on the urinary tract: the organ system that was mainly affected by repeated oral treatment with NTA is the urinary tract with lesions at several sites: in the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder. histomorphologic kidney lesions were discovered at several segments: the cortex area, the renal papilla and the renal pelvis. the epithelium of the proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex region was found to be primarily affected. another target tissue was the transitional cell epithelium (urothelium) of the renal pelvis, the ureters and the urinary bladder. gross findings after repeated administration were red-brown discoloured urine, enlarged kidneys, increased kidney to body ratio, discoloured kidneys, rough surface of the kidneys, hydronephrosis (pelvic dilation) and dilated ureters. one of the predominant microscopic lesions induced by NTA occurred primarily in the proximal tubules of the cortex region and was consistently reported as vacuolisation (of non-hyperplastic epithelial cells), degeneration of the tubular epithelium, and simple and nodular hyperplasia of the tubules. tubular hyperplasia was reported to be frequently associated with vacuolisation of tubular cells. There also were basophilic (regenerative) hyperplasias without cellular vacuolation. erosion/ulceration and hyperplasia of the transitional cell epithelium were observed in the renal pelvis. in studies with sequential sacrifices every fourth day, development of pelvic lesion started later and at a higher dose than tubular damage. after 7 weeks of NTA treatment, transitional cells also appeared to be dysplastic, and showed intracytoplasmic globules, and mitotic figures. lesions at these two main loci may be associated to secondary responses as a sequelae to the epithelial cytotoxity. they consisted of inflammation (interstitial or subepithelial), haemorrhage, fibrosis, dilatation of tubules and collection ducts, and tubular mineralisation of these lesions. ultrastructurally, cellular lesions in the tubules were characterised as swelling, vacuolar degeneration of cytoplasmatic organels (endoplasmatic reticulum, mitochondria) and cell lysis(ref.1). the eu rar report on Trisodium nitrilotriacetate (NTA) (1) summarized the NOAELs and LOAELs from the oral repeated dose rat and mice studies. the estimated NOAELs varied from 10 mg/kg bw/day (10 week rat study) to 169 mg/kg bw/day (18 months + 3 months recovery mouse study). the estimated LOAELs varied from 97 mg/kg bw/day (2 year rat study) to 1400 (4 week rat study). it is proposed to use a NOAEL of 92 mg/kg bw/day for non-cancer endpoint. this NOAEL is derived from the 24 month cancer study (41). a NTA concentration applied as 2.5% NTA aqueous solution (2 ml, ≈ 50 mg/kg bw/d) was without irritation thus representing the NOAEL for local effects on the rabbit  dermis.

SOPP also affected the kidneys and urinary bladder, as well as the liver, in rats. the liver effects of SOPP included significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase (alt) activity in the males and females. kidney effects induced by SOPP in both sexes included increased organ weight and pyelonephritis. ingestion of SOPP (but not OPP) favoured the excretion of alkaline urine in both sexes of rats. subchronic oral toxicity data are also available for mice (SOPP) and dogs (OPP). except for body weight reduction, mice (both sexes) fed diets coNTAining up to 40000 ppm SOPP for 13 weeks showed no treatment-related pathology in the liver, kidney, and bladder. in both sexes of dogs, OPP induced a dose-dependent increase in emetic activity. in a 4-week dermal exposure study of OPP in mice (both sexes), the only effect reported was ulcerative skin lesions. no repeat dose studies were provided for pOPP." ;
