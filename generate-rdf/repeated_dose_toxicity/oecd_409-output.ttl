Decreases in body weights and food consumption and/or clinical signs of toxicity were observed after subacute oral administration of BMHC A at doses of ≥50 mg/kg bw/day (rats) and ≥200 mg/kg bw/day (dogs). Irrespective of the length of treatment period, in oral studies rats were found more sensitive than dogs to this compound. Clinical chemistry and histopathological examinations repeatedly revealed adverse effects on the liver and male reproductive system (testicular toxicity; cf. 3.3.8.). Decreases in plasma cholinesterase activity levels in both sexes of rats were observed after oral exposure to ≥25 mg/kg bw/day for 90 days. In addition, effects on adrenal glands in females were also observed at the same dose levels. From this most meaningful oral study, with respect to the doses administered, a NOAEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day can be derived for systemic effects. On the other hand, dermal administration in rats for 5 days led to adverse effects (including testicular toxicity) only at excessive dose levels (2000 mg/kg bw/day).
