At the end of the treatment period all animals were killed, necropsied and examined post mortem. Detailed clinical observations and function tests (sensory reactivity to stimuli, grip strength, and motor activity) required in the applied guideline were not examined in this study because this study was conducted as a preliminary study of a 90-day repeated dose study. All animals were euthanised after blood sampling for the haematology and blood chemistry tests and then were subjected to necropsy. Organs were weighed and pathological examination was performed. Moreover, to investigate whether FPK-145 has potential to induce micronuclei in rat bone marrow cells in vivo, the micronucleus test was carried out using a portion of left femur obtained at scheduled necropsy.

SCCS considers increased cholesterol and increased relative liver weights of a magnitude above 50% at the highest dose level as adverse effects, although only in the absence of any associated microscopic changes in liver, as histopathological changes in the liver cannot be expected to be observed in this study because of the short study duration (28 days). based on the findings in this 28-day study, the mid-dose level of 300 mg/kg bw/day is considered as the NOAEL for the test substance used in this study. however, for vetiveryl acetate, based on the submitted study, a NOAEL for repeated dose toxicity cannot be evaluated as only partial and insufficient information on the composition of vetiveryl acetate on the market is reported and as the composition of the test substance used in the submitted 28-day study is unknown to the SCCS. subm. 3: the SCCS noted that the NOAEL value was incorrectly reported as 300 mg/kg bw in submission 2 instead of 350 mg/kg bw.

The SCCS agrees on the NOAEL of 5 mg/kg bw/day for local effects in the stomach probably due to the irritative properties of the test substance. The SCCS also considers 5 mg/kg bw/day as a NOAEL for systemic toxicity (decreased body weight gain in females, 86% of control) although it can be argued that the decreased body weight gain might be secondary to the local effects in the stomach. Overall SCCS comment to the submitted subchronic toxicity studies: an oral 26-week study in rats is included in submission ii and in the company submission and described above. The SCCS notes that this study was also included in submission I. the sccp concluded that the quality of the dossier was such that an adequate assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride (p97) was not possible. In addition to this study, submission II (and submission I) also includes several other oral subchronic studies. None of these studies have been evaluated in this opinion because they were either submitted as a poorly legible pdf-file, or were only described in secondary literature and therefore, are not consideted to add any valuable information for the safety assessment of Cetylpyridinium chloride as a cosmetic ingredient." ;
