(equivalent to a 2% solution) the corneal opacities in males (1 mid and 4 high dose) were attributed to direct eye contact, causing local irritation, as microscopic eye examination did not reveal any other treatment-related lesions. chromodacryorrhoea was not considered toxicologically significant. however, there was a doserelated increase in the occurrence and severity of chromodacryorrhoea in females by the end of the dosing period. this suggests that these could be cholinergic effects, since overproduction of porphyrin from the Harderian gland is indicative of a non-specific response to stress. the three females (1 mid and 2 high dose) that exhibited behavioural changes also had chromodacryorrhoea, which supports this. this, in conjunction with the higher incidence of corneal opacities in males, suggests that the ophthalmic effects were systemic rather than due to direct contact. the statistically significant reduced platelet and urea values (high-dose males), and increased cholesterol values (high-dose females) were considered to be not toxicologically significant as they were within the normal variation for rats of this age and strain. comments submitted under the public consultation to the sccs opinion on tetrabromophenol blue, colipa n° c183 (sccs/1479/11, adopted 26-27 June 2012) the applicant would like to comment that the findings on corneal opacity in the sub-chronic study are not inconsistent with the negative findings in the eye irritation study. a comparison of both study results is not possible because a single dose of the test material was used in the irritation study vs. repeated potential eye exposure in the sub-chronic oral toxicity study. repeated exposure to the eye as a result of grooming behaviour, and microlesions on the cornea occurring as a result of grooming, could very easily have produced an irritant or corrosive effect on the eye. blue discoloration of the fur is suggestive of such exposure to the test material occurring as a result of grooming behaviour. bacterial infections of microlesions of the cornea are known to directly induce degenerative processes, which will cause corneal opacity. furthermore, no degenerative processes (protein denaturation and accompanying light reflection disturbance) were observed in the lens and the vitreous body during histopathological examination. therefore, a systemic effect is considered unlikely. the applicant would also like to comment on the changes in the erythrocyte count in males observed at 10 and 100 mg/ kg bw. although statistically significant, in our opinion these observations can be concluded to be normal variations within the physiological range for that strain and age. the lack of histopathological evidence for a disturbance of haematopoiesis in the spleen, the bone marrow or the liver supports that interpretation. finally, the applicant would like to comment on the observed chromodacryorrhea in the treated animals. although there was a higher incidence in treated females, chromodacryorrhea was also observed in controls. chromodacryorrhea can occur as a non-specific response to stress, especially to environmental stress. treatment with a test material could induce a higher level of stress and lead to a higher incidence of chromodacryorrhea in a treatment-related manner (discomfort after gavage, bad taste, etc.). If a direct cholinergic effect was involved, a clear dose response relationship would be expected, i.e., a ten-fold difference in dose between the mid and high dose would be expected to lead to a dramatic increase in chromodacryorrhea, this was not observed. therefore, the applicant considers that a direct cholinergic effect of the test material is unlikely. based on the arguments above, the applicant concludes that a NOAEL of 100 mg/kg bw/day (expressed as administered dose) is justified for the 90-day oral toxicity study. the applicant acknowledges that this difference in interpretation regarding the NOAEL from this study does not impact the MoS calculation because the applicant has used the NOAEL from the developmental toxicity study (3 mg/kg bw/day) for the calculation. reassessment by the SCCS: the current SCCS agrees with the previous evaluation of the SCCNFP in 2004, as well as with the reassessment of the previous SCCS, i.e. the noael is 3 mg/kg bw/day based on the ophthalmological and haematological findings at the higher dose levels in this study. the NOAEL of 3 mg/kg bw/day is taken forward to the MoS calculation.","1 (submission 1), 1 (submission 2) ",,,,2,,
