(1992) have shown that incidence and severity of cardiac fibroses in the same strain of rats could be reduced by food restriction (i.e. lower body weight gain). analysis of the weight gains of rats revealed, that weight gains in females in the imai (1991) study were suppressed by 52.5 – 55 % compared to controls and at this body weight reduction – when compared to controls - grade 2-3 fibrosis was significantly reduced, whereas grade 1 fibrosis was increased. in the study by wahle and christenson (1996) body weight gains of females at the highest opp dose were reduced by 15 % compared to controls. it is questionable whether this reduction of body weight reduction would have had an effect on the prevention of cardiac degeneration and fibrosis.
