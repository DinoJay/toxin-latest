SCCS considers the argumeNTAtion by CalEPA to consider 49 mg/kg bw/d as LOAEL based on cardiac degeneration as not robust enough to set a LOAEL based on the following grounds: (1) the incidence of cardiac degeneration and fibrosis was in general very high which indicates that age of the rats might have contributed to this finding (2) there was no dose-relationship and at the highest dose, the incidence was 46 %, i.e. lower than in controls. calepa argues that low incidences of cardiac degeneration and fibrosis in the high dose group might be due to reduced weight gain in that group. imai et al. (1992) have shown that incidence and severity of cardiac fibroses in the same strain of rats could be reduced by food restriction (i.e. lower body weight gain). analysis of the weight gains of rats revealed, that weight gains in females in the imai (1991) study were suppressed by 52.5 – 55 % compared to controls and at this body weight reduction – when compared to controls - grade 2-3 fibrosis was significantly reduced, whereas grade 1 fibrosis was increased. in the study by wahle and christenson (1996) body weight gains of females at the highest OPP dose were reduced by 15 % compared to controls. it is questionable whether this reduction of body weight reduction would have had an effect on the prevention of cardiac degeneration and fibrosis.

",,"all animals receiving oral doses of Transcutol HP were systemically exposed to DEGEE and EEAA. The systemic exposure (AUC and Cmax) to DEGEE and EEAA in male and female dogs generally increased with increasing dosage. exposure to DEGEE increased more than proportionally to the increase in Transcutol HP dosage in terms of AUC, while it increased proportionally in terms of Cmax regardless of evaluation day or gender. exposure to EEAA appeared to increase less than proportionally to the increase in Transcutol HP dosage in terms of Cmax, but proportionally in terms of aAUCuc. for male and female dogs, systemic exposure to DEGEE and EEAA typically increased from day 0 to day 86 at 400 and 1000 mg/kg/day, and decreased from day 0 to day 86 at 2000/1500 mg/kg/day. the ratios of AUC0-t for the metabolite, EEAA, to the parent drug, DEGEE, ranged from less than 1 to 2.7, but were typically about 1 to 2 regardless of dosage level. generally less than 5% of degee dose was eliminated unchanged in the urine over a 24 hour period, whereas about half of the dose was eliminated in the urine over the same period as EEAA. the respective perceNTAges of dose eliminated in the urine as the parent drug or the metabolite were similar on day 0 and day 86. the ratios of metabolite/parent excreted in urine over 24 hours post-dosing decreased with increasing dosage on both evaluation days, suggesting saturation of the metabolism of the parent and/or of the elimination of the metabolite. ",slight differences from controls in isolated clinical pathology parameters in haematology [mcv and mch] were observed in all groups at study week 13. these differences from controls were relatively small and were considered to represent residual effects of a regenerative response in the case of the red blood indices or compensatory/adaptive mechanisms in the case of slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase and/or urine differences in urine parameters to eliminate the test substance.,"slight differences from controls in isolated clinical pathology parameters in urine chemistry [specific gravity, osmolality, pH and electrolyte balance] were observed in all groups at study week 13. these differences from controls were relatively small and were considered to represent residual effects of a regenerative response in the case of the red blood indices or compensatory/adaptive mechanisms in the case of slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase and/or urine differences in urine parameters to eliminate the test substance.","slight differences from controls in isolated clinical pathology parameters in serum chemistry [alkaline phosphatase, albumin, a/g ratio, chloride, bicarbonate] were observed in all groups at study week 13. these differences from controls were relatively small and were considered to represent residual effects of a regenerative response in the case of the red blood indices or compensatory/adaptive mechanisms in the case of slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase and/or urine differences in urine parameters to eliminate the test substance.","The animals euthanized in extremis revealed gross pathologically enlarged and discoloured kidneys and dark red areas in gastro-intestinal tract of both sexes correlating with the microscopic findings. The liver weights were increased in the 1000 mg/kg bw group females and the 2000/1500 mg/kg bw animals of both sexes at the scheduled necropsy. However, there were no histological changes which correlated to the increase in liver weights.","The animals euthanized in extremis revealed microscopic findings of renal tubular degeneration in the kidney; ulceration or erosion in the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum and haemorrhage and muscle degeneration in the ileum. There were no histological changes which correlated to the increase in liver weights. Therefore, the liver weight increases can be considered as an adaptive response related to the metabolism of the test article and not as an adverse effect. there were no treatment-related microscopic findings in any organ of any group for the animals surviving to the scheduled necropsy, and the histological alterations in the unscheduled death animals at 2000 mg/kg bw were considered reversible, since there was no histological evidence of injury in the animals continued to be dosed at 1500 mg/kg bw.","biochemistry parametrs alteration, liver relative weight change and urinanalysis alterations",400,NOAEL mg/kg bw/d,,yes,"two males in the 2000 mg/kg bw group had to be euthanized in extremis on study day 7 and one female of this group on study day 15. prior to cessation of dosing and/or on the day of euthanasia, these 3 animals were noted with severe clinical observations including a marked decrease in food consumption, as well as pronounced body weight losses from initiation to the end of dose administration. the most probable cause of morbidity, based on histologic findings, was moderate to severe renal tubular degeneration. ","the study authors concluded that the initial high dose of 2000 mg/kg bw was severely toxic and resulted in premature mortality for 2 males and 1 female within the first 2 weeks. the primary histological alteration contributing to the morbidity for these dogs was severe renal tubular degeneration in the kidney. slightly lower terminal body weights were noted in the 1000 and 2000/1500 mg/kg bw females, but with no correlating decrease in food consumption. slight, non-adverse findings in clinical pathology parameters were noted in the 400, 1000 and/or 2000/1500 mg/kg bw groups and slightly increased liver weights were observed at 1000 mg/kg bw females and at 2000/1500 mg/kg bw in both sexes. they were considered as an adaptive response rather than a sign of toxicity. based on the results of this study, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for oral (gavage) administration of Transcutol HP for 13 weeks was considered to be at least 1000 mg/kg bw.",,,,,,,99.9,,,450449013,test substance: Transcutol HP,dog/beagle,,5 to 6 ,months ,f & m,,6.3 to 9.1 (males) and 5.3 to 7.9 (females),kg,"12 (control, high dose group), 8 (low, mid dose groups)","0, 400, 1000, 2000/1500  ",mg/kg bw,5,once daily for 13 consecutive weeks,"yes, gavage",,,,,,,,,deionized water ,,"30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after dose administration on study days 0 and 86 (blood samples). 24 hours on study days 0 and 86 (urine samples)",,13 weeks,2007,yes,"SCCS notes that the absolute and relative liver weight in the 1000 mg/kg bw/day female group is increased by 11.7% (non-significant) and 22.7% (p= 0.01), respectively. alkaline phosphatase was significantly increased both among males (p = 0.01) and females (p = 0.05) in the 1000 mg/kg bw/day groups as well as in the high dose groups (p = 0.01). urine sodium and chloride was significantly decreased among males in all groups (p = 0.01), but not among females. urine creatinine was significantly decreased among all groups of males (p = 0.01) and in the 1000 mg/kg bw/day and the 2000/1500 mg/kg bw/day groups of females (p = 0.01). the SCCS considers 400 mg/kg bw/day to be the NOAEL of this repeated dose study.",34,,,,"subchronic oral toxicity study according to pharmaceutical guideline (FDA) exceeding the methodology of the OECD 408 testing guideline. the toxicokinetic profile of the parent compounds (i.e. DIETHYLENE GLYCOL MONOETHYL ETHER (DEGEE) (DEGEE) and the metabolite (ethoxyethoxyacetic acid (EEAA)) was investigated. the animals were observed twice daily for mortality and morbidity. clinical examinations were performed daily, and detailed physical examinations were performed weekly. individual body weights were recorded weekly. food consumption was recorded daily and reported weekly. clinical pathology evaluations were performed and renal function parameters were calculated prior to the initiation of dose administration (study week -1) and during study week 13. blood samples for toxicokinetic evaluation (DEGEE and EEAA) were collected from all animals at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after dose administration on study days 0 and 86. additionally, urine samples for toxicokinetic evaluation (degee and eeaa) were collected from all animals for approximately 24 hours on study days 0 and 86. ophthalmic examinations were performed during study weeks -1 and 12. electrocardiograms and heart rate were recorded during study weeks -2 and 12. complete necropsies were performed on all animals, and selected organs were weighed at the scheduled necropsy. selected tissues were examined microscopically from all animals.
