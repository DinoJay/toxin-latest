                "the SCCNFP remarked that according to ref. 15 (ref. 5 subm. 1), a 2% solution of tetrabromophenol blue has not been classified as eye irritating and no corneal opacity was observed at this concentration. however, for the highest dose in this 90-day study, 100 mg per kg bw was administered in 5 ml volume per kg, which corresponds to a 2% solution and the observed ophthalmological effects were attributed to direct eye coNTAct. reassessment by the SCCS: in 2004, only a draft study report was submitted. the final report has now been provided, but it does not change the previous opinion. the SCCNFP commented on the discrepancy in interpretation by the study authors between the eye irritation test and the 90-day study. a 2% solution of tetrabromophenol blue was not classified as an eye irritant, but in the 90-day study, 100 mg per kg bw/d; (equivalent to a 2% solution) the corneal opacities in males (1 mid and 4 high dose) were attributed to direct eye coNTAct, causing local irritation, as microscopic eye examination did not reveal any other treatment-related lesions. chromodacryorrhoea was not considered toxicologically significant. however, there was a doserelated increase in the occurrence and severity of chromodacryorrhoea in females by the end of the dosing period. this suggests that these could be cholinergic effects, since overproduction of porphyrin from the Harderian gland is indicative of a non-specific response to stress. the three females (1 mid and 2 high dose) that exhibited behavioural changes also had chromodacryorrhoea, which supports this. this, in conjunction with the higher incidence of corneal opacities in males, suggests that the ophthalmic effects were systemic rather than due to direct coNTAct. the statistically significant reduced platelet and urea values (high-dose males), and increased cholesterol values (high-dose females) were considered to be not toxicologically significant as they were within the normal variation for rats of this age and strain. comments submitted under the public consultation to the SCCS opinion on tetrabromophenol blue, colipa n° c183 (SCCS/1479/11, adopted 26-27 June 2012) the applicant would like to comment that the findings on corneal opacity in the sub-chronic study are not inconsistent with the negative findings in the eye irritation study. a comparison of both study results is not possible because a single dose of the test material was used in the irritation study vs. repeated potential eye exposure in the sub-chronic oral toxicity study. repeated exposure to the eye as a result of grooming behaviour, and microlesions on the cornea occurring as a result of grooming, could very easily have produced an irritant or corrosive effect on the eye. blue discoloration of the fur is suggestive of such exposure to the test material occurring as a result of grooming behaviour. bacterial infections of microlesions of the cornea are known to directly induce degenerative processes, which will cause corneal opacity. furthermore, no degenerative processes (protein denaturation and accompanying light reflection disturbance) were observed in the lens and the vitreous body during histopathological examination. therefore, a systemic effect is considered unlikely. the applicant would also like to comment on the changes in the erythrocyte count in males observed at 10 and 100 mg/ kg bw. although statistically significant, in our opinion these observations can be concluded to be normal variations within the physiological range for that strain and age. the lack of histopathological evidence for a disturbance of haematopoiesis in the spleen, the bone marrow or the liver supports that interpretation. finally, the applicant would like to comment on the observed chromodacryorrhea in the treated animals. although there was a higher incidence in treated females, chromodacryorrhea was also observed in controls. chromodacryorrhea can occur as a non-specific response to stress, especially to environmeNTAl stress. treatment with a test material could induce a higher level of stress and lead to a higher incidence of chromodacryorrhea in a treatment-related manner (discomfort after gavage, bad taste, etc.). If a direct cholinergic effect was involved, a clear dose response relationship would be expected, i.e., a ten-fold difference in dose between the mid and high dose would be expected to lead to a dramatic increase in chromodacryorrhea, this was not observed. therefore, the applicant considers that a direct cholinergic effect of the test material is unlikely. based on the arguments above, the applicant concludes that a NOAEL of 100 mg/kg bw/day (expressed as administered dose) is justified for the 90-day oral toxicity study. the applicant acknowledges that this difference in interpretation regarding the NOAEL from this study does not impact the MoS calculation because the applicant has used the NOAEL from the developmeNTAl toxicity study (3 mg/kg bw/day) for the calculation. reassessment by the SCCS: the current SCCS agrees with the previous evaluation of the SCCNFP in 2004, as well as with the reassessment of the previous SCCS, i.e. the NOAEL is 3 mg/kg bw/day based on the ophthalmological and haematological findings at the higher dose levels in this study. the NOAEL of 3 mg/kg bw/day is taken forward to the MoS calculation." ;

No elevation in AST concentration was observed at the end of the study in males or females at doses of up to 10 mg/kg bw/d.

Functional observation battery (FOB) and locomotor activity assessments were performed in week 12. Vaginal lavage samples were collected daily for the last 28 days of the treatment period and on the day of scheduled necropsy for estrous cycle evaluations. Ophthalmological examinations were conducted on all animals, once during the acclimatisation period and once prior to scheduled necropsy. Blood samples for clinical pathology examinations, haematology and clinical chemistry parameters were collected on the day of scheduled necropsy from all rats after an overnight fasting period. For the assessment of urinalysis parameters, only urine from female animals (obtained after overnight fasting on the day of necropsy) was taken. On the day of scheduled necropsy, all animals were examined macroscopically and the weights of selected organs were determined. Full histopathology was performed on the preserved organs/tissues of all premature decedents and of the animals of the control and high dose groups. Due to lesions observed in high-dose group animals, the liver was also examined microscopically in lowand mid-dose group animals. All gross lesions of all animals were examined. Male reproductive assessments were conducted including sperm motility, sperm concentration, sperm morphology and spermatid counts. The dose formulations used in this study were analysed for test-item concentration and homogeneity using a validated HPLC method. Stability analyses demonstrated that the test item is stable in PEG 300 at room temperature and protected from light for 24 hours and under refrigerated conditions (2-8 C) and protected from light for 10 days at concentrations bracketing those used in the present study." ;

Prussian blue stain detects ferric ions in loosely bound protein complexes, as in hemosiderin. because increased prussian blue staining occurred concurrently with the presence of pigment-laden macrophages and/or kupffer cells in the liver and spleen, the pigment likely represented hemosiderin, according to the study report authors, and suggested red blood cell damage and/or haemolysis as a possible aetiology. this was further supported by the minimal to mild reduction in red blood cell mass in males given 20 mg/kg/day and females given 8 and 20 mg/kg bw/day. because evidence for effects on red blood cells persisted in the recovery phase females, the test article-related morphological changes were considered toxicologically relevant by the study report authors. no differences were observed in the 2.5 and the 5.0 mg/kg bw/day dose groups.
