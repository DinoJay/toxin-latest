females -8% to -10%). pooled data of both sexes gave a dose-response relationship with reduced values of -5% to -8% compared with controls. values of all dose groups normalised during the recovery phase, whereas an increase of 5.5% was noted for females at 0.5% in the diet. 6) in females, statistically significant increases of 2% both in haemoglobin and haematocrit were observed in the dose group of 0.2% in diet. these are considered to be of no toxicological significance. a marginal but statistically significant increase in mcv (+1%) was seen in the dose group 0.5% in diet. no changes in other red blood cell parameters were observed in females at the high dose. in males no statistically significant changes in the red blood cell parameters (hgb, hct, mcv, mch, and mchc) were observed. therefore the marginal increase in mcv in high-dose females can be considered an incidental finding. 7) activated partial thromboplastin time was marginally increased by around 1 second compared with control for females at 0.5% at the end of the treatment period but not after the recovery period. there were no macroscopic changes that were considered treatment-related. the only histopathological change related to treatment was a reduced level of total parenchymal lipid deposition in male rats at 0.5% (observed following oil red o staining). this was not apparent at the recovery sacrifice. the study authors judged that this change was not of toxicological significance.",,164,"noel, mg/kg bw/day",,,no,,"the study director set the noel at the dietary level of 0.2%, which corresponded to a mean intake of 164 mg/kg/day. the main findings at the 0.5% level were judged by the study director to be the reversible lower food utilisation efficiency in males, the reversible higher water consumption in females, the reduced plasma total cholesterol which was still present in males during week 18, the reversible serum total protein in males, and the reduced platelets which were still lower than control during week 18. the summary report does not define a noael.",homogeneity and stability of 2-phenoxyethanol in the test diet was assessed in a previous study,,,,"0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5",,≥95,,,s16022T01,diets in this 13-week study were analysed on three occasions during the study for concentration of 2-phenoxyethanol and were within acceptable limits.,in vivo,rat/colworth wistar,,,,f & m,,,,30,"0,40, 81, 164, 419","mg/kg bw/day, mean combined male and female intake",,single,"yes, diet",,,,,,,,,diet,,,90 days,90 + 35,1993,no,"an amendment to the study plan indicated that only a non-glp summary report would be produced because the study was “deemed to be a low-priority study for which full reporting will not be necessary”. the study documentation is incomplete. methodology used is not described. analytical data on the purity of the test substance that might be critical regarding study evaluation is not available. in conclusion, the study is considered of limited value because of incomplete study documentation and unclear circumstances such as the unusual discontinuing of a glp study and downgrading to a non-glp status and the late study summary report, i.e. 5 years after the in-life phase.",11,"a dose range-finding study (4 weeks treatment) was mentioned with dosing of 0.00%, 0.05%, 0.10%, 0.20% and 0.50% of the test substance in the diet corresponding to about 0, 50, 100, 200 and 500 mg/kg bw/day. some minor effects were observed at the highest dose, which were not considered adverse (no details described). therefore, a NOAEL at the dietary level of 0.50% corresponding to 550 mg/kg bw/day was concluded.","30 animals in control group received the untreated diet for the same period. an additional 5 male and 5 female recovery group rats were included in the control and high dose groups, and after the 13-week treatment period were maintained on the untreated control diet for a further 5 weeks to assess the reversibility of any changes seen.",3,,"comments of the applicant on study reliability: the in-life portion of this study was conducted in accordance with glp, which included an audit of the study protocol and study-based inspections at key points during the study. on completion of the study, a protocol amendment was produced to state that only a non-glp summary report would be produced. therefore, no claim of glp compliance can be made for the study report. on completion of the study, all raw data and records were retained indefinitely. the test material was analysed by gc-ms and by 13c nmr and was considered suitable for test materials with the volatility exhibited by 2-phenoxyethanol. this method was limited to a capability of confirming purity at a level of >95%. the method would be expected to detect other volatile/semi-volatile impurities;

","esfa, emea, cir, cot, bfr, vkm, ansm, scf",,,3,,"the scf set a tolerable upper intake level (UL) for preformed vitamin a (retinol, retinal, retinyl esters and retinoic acid) of 3000 μg re/day (or 10 000 IU) for women of childbearing age and men, based on the risk of teratogenicity and hepatotoxicity. this UL also applies during pregnancy and lactation. ULs for children were extrapolated from the UL for adults, based on allometric scaling (body weight to the power of 0.75). ULs were set at 800 μg re/day for children aged 1–3 years, 1 100 μg re/day for children aged 4–6 years, 1 500 μg re/day for children aged 7–10 years, 2 000 μg re/day for children aged 11–14 years and 2 600 μg re/day for children aged 15–17 years. in a subsequent assessment which considered studies published until 2004, the scientific advisory committee on nutrition (sacn, 2005) concluded that the evidence of an association between high intake of retinol and poor bone health was inconsistent. the committee noted that some epidemiological data suggest that a retinol intake of 1500 μg/day and above is associated with an increased risk of bone fracture; the evidence was considered not robust enough to set a safe upper level, and a guidance level for retinol intake of 1500 μg/day was set for adults for individuals at greater risk of osteoporosis and bone fracture (particularly post-menopausal women) (efsa, 2008, 2013). the efsa nda panel (efsa, 2015) was aware that additional observational studies on possible associations between retinol and vitamin a intake and bone health have been published since the scf and sacn assessments. an overview of prospective cohort and nested case–control studies which investigated an association of retinol or “vitamin a” intake with the risk of bone fracture has been performed. based on this review, the panel considered that evaluation of the data published since the scf assessment does not change the conclusion from that of the scf with respect to the association between retinol or vitamin a intake and risk of bone fracture in postmenopausal women. in summary, the critical adverse effects of high intakes of vitamin a are different at different stages of life, such as bulging fontanelles in infants, decreased bone density and increased bone fracture in middle aged and elderly women, and teratogenicity in women of child-bearing age. hepatotoxicity and altered lipid metabolism are also relevant for adults.

moderate increase in the leukocyte count and in the mean relative and absolute values of neutrophils in the high dose group; at this high dose group effects on lymphocytes and monocyte count were observed. these effects were considered test item related and were reversible at the end of the recovery period. non dose related platelet effects were also observed in the males from the medium and high dose group. clinical biochemistry changes were observed in males and females from the high dose group only at the end of the treatment. these effects may reflect metabolic changes. effects on the electrolyte parameters Na+, Cl- (males and females) were observed and related to the nature of the test item itself (sodium salt) and most of these effects regressed during recovery. some minor changes in parameters of urinalysis were observed in males and females rats from the high dose group and urine discoloration in males rats from the medium dose group. increase in urine turbidity was also observed in male rats from the high dose group. all these effects were reversible after the recovery period. increase in liver, kidney and spleen weights and in their ratios to body and brain weights were observed at the end of treatment in rats from the high dose group. these effects were considered related to the treatment. they were reversible after the recovery period. decreases in mean testes weights, testes to body and brain weights ratios were observed in male rats from the high dose group at the end of treatment. these effects were not reversible after the recovery period. decreases in mean epididymidis weights, epididymidis to body and brain weights ratios were observed in male rats from the high dose group at the end of the recovery period but not during the treatment. macroscopic and microscopic examination after terminal necropsy showed lesions in the testes and epididymides of male rats from the high dose group: size reduction of testes (in nine rats) and epididymides (in six rats) and concerning epididymides thickening (in one rat), nodules (in one rat), foci (in two rats) or cysts (in two rats). severe tubular degeneration, sperm granuloma, azoospermia or oligospermia were reported on the testis of nine rats from the high dose group; these lesions were also observed after the recovery period. as prostate and seminal vesicles were not affected, the authors considered that a testosterone effect is unlikely and the lesions recorded are considered to be of primary cytotoxic nature to sperm. macroscopic lesions (foci or thickening) were also observed on stomach, caecum or mesenteric lymph nodes of some male or female rats. icroscopic findings on gastrointestinal tracts as ulceration or inflammation, fibrosis were reported on some male or female rats from the medium or high dose groups, some of them were always observed after the recovery period. microscopic findings were reported in the spleen and bone marrow in rats from the high dose group of both sexes (extramedullary and medullary hemopoiesis), in the liver in male or female rats from the medium or high dose groups (hepatocellular hypertrophy, in the kidneys in male or female rats from the medium or high dose groups (tubular cell swelling) and in the adrenals in male rats from the high dose group (cortical vacuolation). these findings were not longer present after the recovery period. extramedullary and medullary hemopoiesis were considered by the authors of minor severity degrees and secondary to intestinal perforation, inflammation and haemorrhage. hepatocellular hypertrophy was considered to be of adaptative metabolic nature. increased cortical vacuolation in adrenals was considered related to stress hormone production (fatty change) and the nature of the renal lesions was considered unclear.","deep yellow urine, slight tan fur, hgher food consumption, haematological changes, clinical biochemistry alteration, changes in parametrs of urinalysis",5,"noael  mg/kg bw/day, corresponding to 3.1 mg/kg bw/day active ingredient","haematological system, spleen, kidney, liver, testes, epididymides, gastrontestinal tract,",,no,,"sodium picramate revealed primary findings of toxicity in the testes/epididymides and gastrointestinal tract. due to haemototoxicity and microscopic findings in the gastro-intestinal tract, liver and kidney at 15 mg/kg bw/d the noael in rats after daily oral treatment is determined to be 5 mg/kg bw/day, corresponding to 3.1 mg/kg bw/day active ingredient.",stability: 7 days in vehicle under storage conditions,,,,,paste with 30% water,62.4,,,50/04,test substance: sodium picramate,in vivo,rat/hanbrl:wist (spf),,,,f & m,,,,20,"0, 5, 15, 80 ",mg/kg bw/day ,10,daily ,"yes, gavage",,,,,,,,,bi-distilled water,,,> 90days,91 + 28,2005,yes,,13,study reference 14," the control animals received the vehicle alone (bi-distilled water), group 1 and 4: + 5 males and 5 females for 4 weeks recovery)",2,7 months,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

the respective incidence in the controls were 7 %, 4 %, and 2 %). the female histological data for the 4000 ppm group exhibited increased (p<0.05) incidences of retinal degeneration (27 % incidence vs. 7 % in the controls) and optic nerve atrophy (29 % incidence vs. 13 % in the controls). the incidences of these eye effects did not similarly increase in the 10000 ppm female group. supplemental data submitted by the registrant to calepa indicated that there were problems in the reporting of the various evaluations that pertain to the eyes and optic nerves (ophthalmology, clinical observations, necropsy, and histology) for this study. since opp and its metabolites are chemically similar to the metabolites of naphthalene, which are responsible for its cataractogenic activity (gehring, 1971, wells et al., 1989), potential injury to the vision system attributable to opp administration in both sexes should not be dismissed without further investigation. b) cardiac effects: in the terminal sacrifice females, the incidences of cardiac degeneration and (or) fibrosis in both the controls and high-dose groups were comparable (54 % and 46 %, respectively). by contrast, the mid- and low-dose groups exhibited increased (p<0.05) incidences (84 % and 75 %, respectively). although the elevated incidence did not occur in the high-dose females, this group showed reductions in feed consumption and body weight gain and feed restriction/body weight reduction is known to reduce the incidence and severity of cardiac fibrosis in both sexes of f344 rats (imai et al., 1991). in the 2-year terminal sacrifice males, the incidences of vascular mineralisation involving the wall of the heart-base vessels in the 0, 800, 4000, and 8000 ppm groups were 2 %, 8 %, 22 % (p<0.05) and 11 %, respectively. with respect to the heart effects in females, calepa derived a loael of 49 mg/kg bw/d from this study.","histopathology alteration of urinary bladder, ureter dilatation and/or transitional cell hyperplasia, alteratin of renal tubule, cardiac effect",39;

(1992) have shown that incidence and severity of cardiac fibroses in the same strain of rats could be reduced by food restriction (i.e. lower body weight gain). analysis of the weight gains of rats revealed, that weight gains in females in the imai (1991) study were suppressed by 52.5 – 55 % compared to controls and at this body weight reduction – when compared to controls - grade 2-3 fibrosis was significantly reduced, whereas grade 1 fibrosis was increased. in the study by wahle and christenson (1996) body weight gains of females at the highest opp dose were reduced by 15 % compared to controls. it is questionable whether this reduction of body weight reduction would have had an effect on the prevention of cardiac degeneration and fibrosis.

creatinine: +16% and +22%, at 100 and 400 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). as these were not associated with any relevant microscopic findings, they were considered to be of minor toxicological significance. changes in blood glucose levels were also noted in the upper two dose groups (males: -8% and –11%; females: -10% and –9%, at 100 and 400 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). all individual values were close to or within the historical control range and the change was not considered to be of toxicological importance. some other haematological and biochemical parameters showed individual minor statistical differences, but these were not dose-related and were within the historical control range. there were no treatment-related changes in urinalysis. the absolute kidney weight was lower (87% of control) for males treated with 100 mg/kg bw/day, but not at the higher dose and it was therefore not considered to be relevant. there were no other significant differences in the organ weights. microscopic examination revealed minimal to slight brownish pigment accumulation in many organs and tissues (kidneys, alimentary tract, liver and /or mesenteric lymph nodes in animals given 100 or 400 mg/kg bw/day. tubular basophilia was noted in some animals of all male dose groups, including controls, but was more severe in males given 400 mg/kg bw/day. minimal to moderate subacute to chronic aspiration pneumonia was reported in 1/10 females at 25 mg/kg bw/day, 5/10 males and 6/10 females at 100 mg/kg bw/day and 5/10 males and 5/10 females at 400 mg/kg bw/day. brownish pigment-laden macrophages were present within the lesion for the animals of the two upper dose groups, but not for the female treated at 25 mg/kg bw/day. no other relevant changes were reported. remark: the aspiration pneumonia seen in one female rat at 25 mg/kg bw/day was disregarded as non-significant by the study authors, because of the absence of pigmentation. however, on the basis of the information provided, it is not appropriate to discount the possibility that the observation was treatment-related. this would lead to the conclusion that 25 mg/kg bw/day is a loel, rather than a noel. tubular basophilia is normally associated with regeneration following kidney damage. since it was also seen in controls in this study, the significance is unclear but may be related to exacerbation of a pre-existing condition.

(equivalent to a 2% solution) the corneal opacities in males (1 mid and 4 high dose) were attributed to direct eye contact, causing local irritation, as microscopic eye examination did not reveal any other treatment-related lesions. chromodacryorrhoea was not considered toxicologically significant. however, there was a doserelated increase in the occurrence and severity of chromodacryorrhoea in females by the end of the dosing period. this suggests that these could be cholinergic effects, since overproduction of porphyrin from the Harderian gland is indicative of a non-specific response to stress. the three females (1 mid and 2 high dose) that exhibited behavioural changes also had chromodacryorrhoea, which supports this. this, in conjunction with the higher incidence of corneal opacities in males, suggests that the ophthalmic effects were systemic rather than due to direct contact. the statistically significant reduced platelet and urea values (high-dose males), and increased cholesterol values (high-dose females) were considered to be not toxicologically significant as they were within the normal variation for rats of this age and strain. comments submitted under the public consultation to the sccs opinion on tetrabromophenol blue, colipa n° c183 (sccs/1479/11, adopted 26-27 June 2012) the applicant would like to comment that the findings on corneal opacity in the sub-chronic study are not inconsistent with the negative findings in the eye irritation study. a comparison of both study results is not possible because a single dose of the test material was used in the irritation study vs. repeated potential eye exposure in the sub-chronic oral toxicity study. repeated exposure to the eye as a result of grooming behaviour, and microlesions on the cornea occurring as a result of grooming, could very easily have produced an irritant or corrosive effect on the eye. blue discoloration of the fur is suggestive of such exposure to the test material occurring as a result of grooming behaviour. bacterial infections of microlesions of the cornea are known to directly induce degenerative processes, which will cause corneal opacity. furthermore, no degenerative processes (protein denaturation and accompanying light reflection disturbance) were observed in the lens and the vitreous body during histopathological examination. therefore, a systemic effect is considered unlikely. the applicant would also like to comment on the changes in the erythrocyte count in males observed at 10 and 100 mg/ kg bw. although statistically significant, in our opinion these observations can be concluded to be normal variations within the physiological range for that strain and age. the lack of histopathological evidence for a disturbance of haematopoiesis in the spleen, the bone marrow or the liver supports that interpretation. finally, the applicant would like to comment on the observed chromodacryorrhea in the treated animals. although there was a higher incidence in treated females, chromodacryorrhea was also observed in controls. chromodacryorrhea can occur as a non-specific response to stress, especially to environmental stress. treatment with a test material could induce a higher level of stress and lead to a higher incidence of chromodacryorrhea in a treatment-related manner (discomfort after gavage, bad taste, etc.). If a direct cholinergic effect was involved, a clear dose response relationship would be expected, i.e., a ten-fold difference in dose between the mid and high dose would be expected to lead to a dramatic increase in chromodacryorrhea, this was not observed. therefore, the applicant considers that a direct cholinergic effect of the test material is unlikely. based on the arguments above, the applicant concludes that a noael of 100 mg/kg bw/day (expressed as administered dose) is justified for the 90-day oral toxicity study. the applicant acknowledges that this difference in interpretation regarding the noael from this study does not impact the MoS calculation because the applicant has used the noael from the developmental toxicity study (3 mg/kg bw/day) for the calculation. reassessment by the sccs: the current sccs agrees with the previous evaluation of the sccnfp in 2004, as well as with the reassessment of the previous sccs, i.e. the noael is 3 mg/kg bw/day based on the ophthalmological and haematological findings at the higher dose levels in this study. the noael of 3 mg/kg bw/day is taken forward to the MoS calculation.","1 (submission 1), 1 (submission 2) ",,,2,,"reassessment by the sccs: in 2004, only a draft study report was submitted. the final report has now been provided, but it does not change the previous opinion. the sccs commented on the discrepancy in interpretation by the study authors between the eye irritation test and the 90-day study. a 2% solution of tetrabromophenol blue was not classified as an eye irritant, but in the 90-day study, 100 mg per kg bw/d;

the higher absolute neutrophil count may have represented an inflammatory response. effects on clinical chemistry test results were limited to higher bilirubin for females given 20 mg/kg bw/day (200% of the value in the control group), which, according to the study report authors could be associated with haemolysis, which would correlate with the haematology findings and pigment-laden macrophages observed in the liver. mean absolute and relative spleen weights were greater than control values in females given 20 mg/kg bw/day (125 and 129% of the control values, respectively). these weight differences were considered test article-related by the study report authors and correlated with an increased incidence of increased extramedullary haematopoiesis noted microscopically in this group. no statistically significant or test article-related organ weight changes were noted in animals at the recovery phase necropsy. all macroscopic findings were considered spontaneous, incidental, and/or unrelated to the test article by the study report authors.test article-related microscopic findings were noted in the liver and spleen of males and females at the dosing phase necropsy. test article-related findings in the liver includedminimal infiltrates of pigment-laden macrophages/kupffer cells in females given 20 mg/kg bw/day, and minimally increased prussian blue staining in males and females given 20 mg/kg bw/day. in the spleen, test article-related findings included minimal infiltrates of pigment-laden macrophages in males given 20 mg/kg bw/day, minimally increased extramedullary haematopoiesis in males and females given 20 mg/kg bw/day, and minimally increased prussian blue staining in males given 20 mg/kg bw/day and femalesgiven 8 or 20 mg/kg bw/day. prussian blue stain detects ferric ions in loosely bound protein complexes, as in hemosiderin. because increased prussian blue staining occurred concurrently with the presence of pigment-laden macrophages and/or kupffer cells in the liver and spleen, the pigment likely represented hemosiderin, according to the study report authors, and suggested red blood cell damage and/or haemolysis as a possible aetiology. this was further supported by the minimal to mild reduction in red blood cell mass in males given 20 mg/kg/day and females given 8 and 20 mg/kg bw/day. because evidence for effects on red blood cells persisted in the recovery phase females, the test article-related morphological changes were considered toxicologically relevant by the study report authors. no differences were observed in the 2.5 and the 5.0 mg/kg bw/day dose groups.

and clinical signs. detailed clinical observations were carried out weekly and a functional observation battery (including motor activity) was conducted at the end of the treatment period. body weight and food consumption were recorded once a week during the study. ophthalmological examinations were performed before the beginning and at the end of the treatment period. haematological and blood biochemical investigations as well as urinalysis were performed at the end of the treatment period. some parameters were selected to be analyzed at the end of the treatment-free periods. blood samples for the determination of plasma levels of the test item were taken on day 1 and in week 13 from satellite animals at designated time-points. on completion of the treatment or treatment-free period, the animals were sacrificed and submitted to a full macroscopic examination. designated organs were weighed and specified tissues preserved. a microscopic examination was performed on selected tissues from animals in the control and high-dose groups and on macroscopic lesions from all animals killed on completion of the treatment period. in addition, the thyroids and spleen from all animals of the low and mid-dose groups and from those killed on completion of the treatment-free period were microscopically examined. there were no perturbations of the autonomic or physiological functions in any treated group. ptyalism was noted among almost all the animals given 100 mg/kg bw/day. a slightly lower mean body weight gain was noted in males given 100 mg/kg bw/day during the whole dosing period and was most of the time statistically significant. mean male body weight returned to control values during the treatment-free period. no treatment-related effect was noted on females body weight gain. no treatment-related effects were noted on food consumption for either males or females, and there were no ophthalmological treatment-related findings at the end of the treatment period. no treatment-related changes were noted for any haematological or blood biochemical parameters. at the end of the treatment period, the following treatment-related differences from controls were observed in urinary parameters at 100 mg/kg bw/day: .presence of low to high bilirubin levels in all males and in 7/10 females, . traces of nitrites in 8/10 males and 6/10 females, . traces of glucose in 6/10 males and 6/10 females, . marked coloration of urine (from yellow to yellow-brown) in both males and females. all these changes were attributed to treatment and were no longer present on completion of the treatment-free period. however, as there were no changes in plasma levels of bilirubin and glucose, the positive reaction of urinary test strips to glucose and bilirubin at 100 mg/kg bw/day (and most probably also to nitrite) was likely related to an analytical interference due to the renal elimination of 2,4-diaminophenoxyethanol HCl material, as indicated by the marked coloration of urine at this dose-level. plasma concentrations of 2,4-diaminophenoxyethanol HCl were below the limit of quantification at 4 mg/kg bw/day. at 20 mg/kg bw/day, measurable plasma levels were found on both day 1 and in week 13 at 0.5 hours post-dosing. at 100 mg/kg bw/day, test item was found at significant levels on day 1 and in week 13. on both occasions, the maximum mean plasma levels were measured at 0.5 hours post-dosing (first sampling time-point). thereafter, the plasma levels decreased steadily until the last quantifiable timepoint (2 hours on day 1, 8 hours in week 13). there were no apparent sex-related differences. systemic exposure (as measured by AUC0-t) increased with dose-level in a proportional manner, and mean AUC0-t values of 5.22 and 7.40 µg.h/ml were achieved in week 13 for males and females given 100 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. relative kidney weights were increased in the 100 mg/kg bw/day group in females (significant increase) and males. relative thyroids weight was increased at the intermediate dose level in females and the highest dose level in both males and females. since there was no effect on the thyroids at microscopic examination, the increase in thyroids weight in the females of the intermediate dose level was not considered to be a toxicologically relevant effect. brownish coloration of the thyroids was observed in all males and females given 100 mg/kg bw/day and was associated at microscopic examination with brownish pigment deposits in the thyroids (mainly in follicular epithelial cells). there were no associated inflammatory, degenerative or proliferative changes. spleen hemosiderosis was also observed for all animals given 100 mg/kg bw/day. both these microscopic changes on thyroids and spleen were still observed at the end of the

study and weekly thereafter. ophthalmological examinations were performed on all animals of each sex of the control and the high dose group before the beginning of the treatment period and on week 12. in addition, following abnormalities observed in the high dose group, all animals of the low and intermediate dose were examined on week 12. these examinations included corneal reflex and the examination of the appendages, optic media and fundus by indirect ophthalmoscopy. food consumption per cage was determined weekly. haematological, chemical chemistry investigations and urine analysis were performed in week 13. complete necropsies and histopathological exam were performed on all animals. ptyalism was observed at 40 (1/10 males and 2/10 females) from week 10 and at 160 mg/kg bw/d (7/10 males and all females) from week 2. this clinical sign was considered to be treatment-related. yellow/orange coloured urine, was observed in all treated animals, and yellow/orange coloured tail, body extremities or fur in some treated animals, mostly in a dose dependent way. other clinical signs such as regurgitation, scabs on head or on back or scattered hair were not attributed to the test substance. at ophthalmological examination, yellowish bilateral discolouration of the fundus was noted for 7/10 males given 40 mg/kg bw/d and in most animals at 160 mg/kg bw/d, which was attributed to the staining properties of hc yellow n° 7. other minor findings such as unilateral opacification of the lens or corneal vacuolization were observed in some rats. they were considered of no toxicological significance. slight reduced body weight gains were observed in females given 160 mg/kg bw/d, which resulted at the end of the study in a lower mean body weight when compared to the control rats (-7%). no changes in male body weight or in food intake in either sex. some slight differences from controls were noted in the haematological parameters including erythrocyte count, mean cell volume and mean cell haemoglobin in males and packed cell volume, mean cell volume and mean cell haemoglobin concentration in females were noted. they were considered to be of no toxicological significance since they were minor, often not dose-related and the individual values were within or close the normal range of background data. the results of blood biochemistry showed slight differences between treated and control animals: slightly lower glucose in females given 40 and 160 mg/kg bw/d, mean higher blood sodium levels in females given 10 mg/kg bw/d and in males given 40 mg/kg bw/d and mean higher blood inorganic phosphorus levels in females given 40 and 160 mg/kg bw/d and a slight decrease in males given 10 mg/kg bw/d. mean blood urea concentration was also slightly affected in females at 160 mg/kg bw/d as well as mean blood alkaline phosphatase. mean blood albumin concentration was slightly increased in males at 160 mg/kg bw/d. no changes in urinary parameters in rats of either sex. when compared to controls, statistically significant higher mean absolute and relative liver and kidney weights were noted in both sexes at 160 mg/kg bw/d. although they were not associated with relevant histopathological abnormalities, it was considered to be treatmentrelated. the higher mean kidney weight, which is possibly correlated to the higher incidence and severity of tubular basophilia in the treated animals given 40 and 160 mg/kg bw/d, was attributed to the administration of the test substance. no macroscopic findings attributed to treatment with hc yellow n° 7 apart from yellow/orange discolouration of some tissues in animals given 160 mg/kg/d (mesentery, adipose tissue). at microscopic examination, brownish pigment deposits in thyroid follicular epithelial cells were observed for some males and females given 160 mg/kg bw/d. these pigment deposits were well tolerated by the surrounding tissue as there were no associated inflammatory, degenerative or proliferative changes. they were considered to be of minor toxicological importance. when compared to controls, a higher incidence and/or severity of tubular basophilia was observed in both sexes at 40 and 160 mg/kg/d. these changes were sometimes associated with thickening of the tubular basal membrane. although tubular basophilia is commonly found spontaneously in the untreated laboratory rat of this strain and age, its higher incidence in the animals given 40 or 160 mg/kg bw/d was considered to be treatmentrelated.no histopathlogical abnormalities were found in the adipose tissue and mesentery, which showed colouration at macroscopic examination. other findings or minor changes were observed in some treated animals but as they are commonly recorded spontaneously in this
